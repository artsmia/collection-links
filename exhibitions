Bresnahan, who apprenticed with the Japanese Nakazato family of potters, well known for his skillfully thrown, uniquely-glazed ceramics and for his commitment to the environment -- used materials indigenous to Minnesota and stoked his kiln with waste wood gathered from the forests surrounding St. John's. The successful firing of the enormous 1,200 cubic feet, three-chamber kiln marked a high point in Bresnahan's artistic career. In addition to the subtle hues of natural ash glazes, the final chamber of the kiln also yielded unglazed ceramics with flash marks of bright reds and oranges, and contrasting soft tans and browns. This exhibition included 50-60 of these objects, and included large-scale storage jars, vases, platters, and teabowls.","date":"Saturday, April 13, 1996 - Sunday, September 22, 1996","objectId":"5042 9702 9703 38597 38612 38613 38614 38615 38616 38617 38618 38619 38620 38621 38622 38623","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

Dating from 1880s to the 1900s, these works were arranged typologically, beginning with museum, followed by other buildings in the public realm such as churches, hotels, libraries, and office buildings and concluding with domestic architecture for both town and country. \r\nThe majority of the drawings came from the impressive holdings of the Northwest Architectural Archives, University of Minnesota Libraries, St. Paul; in addition, Avery Library, Columbia University, New York, and the Heinz Architectural Center at The Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh, lent less familiar works which created a more comprehensive architectural representation of the Twin Cities.\r\nArchitect highlighted in the exhibition included Edwin Lundie, well known locally for his residential architecture of the 1920s and 1930s; Harvey Ellis, gifted draughtsman for LeRoy Buffington around 1890 and who later designed furniture for Gustav Stickley; William Channing Whitney, designer of homes for many prominent Minnesotans at the turn of the century, and John Howe, a highly talented draughtsman for Frank Lloyd Wright.","date":"Saturday, April 13, 1996 - Sunday, March 30, 1997","objectId":"8357 29399 38601 38602 38603 38604 38605 38606 38607 38608 38609 38610 38611 38631 38632 38633 38637 38638 38639 38648 38649 38650 38651 38652 38653","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

They took to a logical conclusion many of the ideas about landscape that had preoccupied European artists in the 18th and 19th centuries, while retaining the special character of the country they were exploring: magnificent, dramatic and subtle, by turns. The exhibition will include approximately 80 oil paintings featuring works by Bierstadt, Church, Cole, and Cropsey, among others.","date":"Wednesday, February 20, 2002 - Sunday, November 17, 2002","objectId":"452 63194 63288 63290","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

Alexa Horochowski scrutinized that behemoth institution known as marriage in a multi-sensory laundry room equipped with bubbles, a working ringer washer, and clothes line installed with embroidered underwear. Lee Anne Swanson combined hi-tech materials and lo-tech ideas in an installation that accessorized a huge, moody painting with a line of waist-high livestock tanks containing splashing glitter-covered mechanical duck decoys. Carolyn Swiszcz revealed her love for accidental gesture and material flexibility in a giant eraser board mandala.","date":"Friday, April 28, 2000 - Sunday, June 18, 2000","objectId":"32539 32540 32541 32542 32543 32544 32545 32546 32547 32548 32549 32550 32551 32552 32553 32554 32555 32556 32557 32558 32559 32560 32561 32562","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

One of the first members of Wrightâs Taliesin Fellowship, which was begun in 1932, Howe was schooled in the principles of organic architecture. In Wrightâs studio, he directed the activities of the drafting room and completed many of Wrightâs presentation drawings. Howe moved to Minnesota in the mid-1960s, where he ran his own architectural practice that focused, like Wrightâs, on domestic architecture. This exhibition was comprised of 75 to 100 drawings mainly from the collections of the Northwest Architectural Archives, and the University Libraries, University of Minnesota. The exhibition coincides with the Frank Lloyd Wright Conservancyâs Annual Meeting, to be held September 20 â 24, 2000 in Minneapolis.","date":"Saturday, September 02, 2000 - Sunday, January 07, 2001","objectId":"32847 32848 32849 32850 32851 32852 32853 32854 32855 32856 32857 32858 32859 32860 32861 32862 32863 32864 32865 32866 32867 32868 32869 32870 32871 32872 32873 32874 32875 32876 32877 32878 32879 32880 32881 32882 32883 32884 32885 32886 32887 32888 32889 32890 32891 32892 32893 32894 32895 32896 32897 32898 32899 32900 32901 32902 32903 32904 32905 32906 32907 32908 32909 32910 32911 32912 32913 32914 32915 32916 32917 32918 32919 32920 32921 32922 32923 32924 32925 32926 32927 32928 32929 32930 32931 32932 32933 32934 32935 32936 32967 32968 32969 32970 32971 32972 32973 32974 32975 32982 32983 32984 32985 32986 32987 32988 32989 32990 33004 33005 33006 33007 33008 33009 33010 33011 33012 33013 33019 33095 33096 33098 33099 33100 33101 33102 33103 33104 33105 33106 33107 33108 33109 33111","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

{"id":228,"title":"Night","description":"This exhibition featured nightscapes by photographer Chris Faust and painter Mike Lynch, artists who for many years have produced work that reveals the essence of the urban landscape. Diligent explorers of the physical worlds they are both drawn to places that seem to stretch over time â empty dock yards, railroad yards, industrial sites, architectural landmarks, and myriad nighttime haunts. Chris Faust is well known for panoramic black-and-white photographs of landscape, images often filled with contradiction and the enduring tension between humans and nature. A disciplined and masterly technician, Faust achieves lush tonal quality through a process called compensation development, which hear leaned from John Sexton, a student of Ansel Adams. Mike Lynch has been recognized for decades as an artist whose oil paintings, watercolors, and drawings display rare economy and sensitivity. He has devoted himself to night scenes since 1953, when he began painting in earnest. Lynch creates his evocative work through the use of time-honored practices such as nineteenth-century British watercolor techniques.","date":"Friday, December 15, 2000 - Sunday, February 11, 2001","objectId":"33602 33610 33611 33612 33613 33614 33615 33616 33617 33618 33619 33620 33621 33622 33623 33624 33625 33626 33627 33660 33661 33662 33663 33664 33665 33666 33678 33714 33715 33716 33717 33718 33719 33720 33721 33722 33723 33724 33725 33726 33727 33728 33729 33730 33731 33732 33733 33734 33735 33736 33737 33738 33739 33740 33741 33742 33743","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

{"id":231,"title":"Body Work: Photographs of Nudes","description":"This exhibition, drawn primarily from the Instituteâs permanent collection, featured the work of about ten internationally known photographers. Their pictures spanned over one hundred years and represented every major movement in photography. Eadweard Muybridge, working in the late 19th-century, included nude men and women extensive analysis of human motion. Edward Steichen, as a turn-of-the-century pictorialist, idealized the nude, making evocative, soft-focus images. And Edward Weston, working after World War I, created modernist images of women, often emphasizing abstract shapes and forms. During the second half of the 20th-century, photographers such as Bill Brandt and July Coleman, continued to engage the human figure in a wide range of imagery, making it one of the mediumâs most enduring subjects.","date":"Saturday, August 26, 2000 - Sunday, January 07, 2001","objectId":"1669 1709 1713 1714 1715 1910 1912 2046 2640 2644 2651 2654 2655 2656 2657 2913 2916 4656 4658 4659 4660 9311 10493 10494 10495 11085 11087 11091 11093 12695 12696 12697 12698 12699 12757 12758 12759 12760 12889 12890 12891 12892 12893 12894 19427 19440 19445 19446 19448 19820 19835 19838 19887 19914 22914 22919 22920 22922 24163 24170 24173 25390 26136 28019 28020 33646 33647 33648 33649 33650 33651 33652 33653 33654 33896 33897 34556 36669","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

The artist glorified the drudgery of domestic work and in so doing created a space for critical reflection about the role of women in the home and what is traditionally seen as \"women's work.\"","date":"Friday, April 19, 1996 - Tuesday, January 28, 1997","objectId":"37323 37324 37325 37326 37327 37328 37329 37330 37331 37332 37333 37334 37671 37672","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

This regionâs diverse landscape - its wide horizons and high arctic sky - has profoundly influenced her work. Well known for her elegantly evocative paintings of magical plant-filled environments, Kreft had depicted mysterious light-filled spaces containing pods, seeds, and various floating organic forms that seem to reflect psychological states of being. Her recent paintings speak to the luminous beauty of the earth. They present natural phenomena and life pattern in simpler spaces that suggest constellations of various sorts. The atmospheric and reductive quality of these large canvases heightened their contemplative effect and encouraged the viewer to linger in the artistâs ethereal landscape.","date":"Monday, July 14, 1997 - Thursday, October 01, 1998","objectId":"39760 39761 39762 39763 39764 39765 39766 39767","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

Each curatorial department was represented. The arrival of more than 60 contemporary works of art from Targetâs corporate art collection, nearly 4,000 textiles from the Jack Lenor Larsen archive donated by Cowtan & Tout in 1999, 475 objects from the Norwest Modernism Collection donated by Wells Fargo in 1998, and the ongoing gifts of Asian art from Ruth and Bruce Dayton all contributed to this opportunity to view an encyclopedic collection of world art. This collection embodied remarkable depth and breadth, providing a solid launching point and establishing a high level of quality for the museumâs future.","date":"Friday, April 06, 2001 - Sunday, May 20, 2001","objectId":"137 139 151 170 193 4136 4137 4171 4210 4258 4358 4383 4395 4482 4487 4566 4567 4636 4652 4730 4734 4735 4758 4765 4784 4797 4842 4912 4950 4980 5018 5030 5033 5064 5137 5140 5181 5205 5235 5267 5289 5297 5472 5576 5599 5610 5613 5618 5642 5683 5746 5747 5767 5863 5864 5896 5927 5937 5947 5970 6196 6712 7105 7158 7159 7897 7952 8241 8385 8386 8387 8388 8389 8419 8420 8421 8422 8431 8891 8949 8950 9379 9760 9892 9960 10020 10037 10436 10601 10619 10632 10673 10975 11654 11842 11915 12068 12111 12115 12117 12118 12701 12703 12716 12717 12718 12719 12720 12721 12722 12723 12724 12725 12726 12727 12728 12729 12730 12731 12732 12733 12734 12735 12736 12737 12763 12776 12786 12790 12806 12825 12828 12829 12830 12887 12898 12936 12957 12958 12959 12960 12963 12964 12965 12966 12983 12986 12987 12988 12989 12998 13011 13027 13030 13048 13064 13066 13067 13068 13069 13070 13072 13074 13079 13086 13088 13089 13101 13102 13103 13104 13105 13106 13107 13108 13109 13134 13141 13183 13185 13188 13190 13193 13194 13196 13212 13243 13248 13292 13293 13427 13606 13621 13622 13696 13697 13698 27632 27794 28136 28325 28420 28533 28591 28639 29394 29402 29653 29746 29757 30352 30635 30704 30774 30797 30808 30834 31132 31143 31246 31260 31263 31264 31265 31266 31267 31268 31269 31270 31353 31355 31377 31402 31403 31404 31405 31406 31407 31408 31409 31440 32364 32411 32419 32484 32816 32818 32939 32940 32941 32942 32943 32944 32945 33030 33031 33032 33033 33034 33035 33036 33037 33040 33045 33050 33137 33138 33139 33140 33141 33142 33143 33144 33145 33146 33147 33148 33199 33200 33203 33605 33685 33704 33820 33822 33823 33825 33829 33830 33831 34007 39468 40311 40367 40368 40395 40448 40843 40877 40885 40941 40942 40943 40944 40945 40979 41006 43597 43975 44264 45193 45220 45247 45250 45253 45258 45261 45277 45348 45349 45359 45383 45384 45385 45386 45437 45500 45501 45535 45539 45543 45547 45549 45578 45579 45580 45581 45796 45798 45802 45818 46099 46101 46102 46106 46107 46110 46111 46112 46129 46131 46140 46141 46164 46165 46166 46167 46168 46169 46170 46171 50092 50137 50140 50491","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

{"id":421,"title":"A Japanese Legacy: Four Generations of Yoshida Family Artists","description":"This exhibition features oil paintings, watercolors and woodblock prints by nine artists from a single Japanese family spanning, four generations and over 100 years. The exhibition addresses the evolution of the popular Japanese print from the late 1800s to present; the adaptation of western stylesânaturalism and abstractionâinto Japanese styles, methods and aesthetics; and, the dynamics of the family tradition in its commercial, stylistic, and interpersonal dimensions. The Yoshida family is fascinating because of the longevity and breadth of the familyâs artistic legacy, its high aesthetic standards, and its internationalism. Thus, this exhibition allows for multiple foci, including aesthetics, production, culture, politics, and personalities.","date":"Sunday, February 03, 2002 - Sunday, April 14, 2002","objectId":"34779 34787 34788 34800 34806 35056 45387 45967 45970 45972 45974 45975 45977 45979 45980 45981 45983 45986 46004 46007 46008 46010 46012 46015 46017 46019 46021 46023 46024 46027 46028 46039 46042 46045 46046 46049 46050 46154 46156 46159 46160 46163 46189 46191 46193 46195 46199 46200 46204 46205 46208 46210 46214 46217 50201 50214 53182 53185 53231 57765 57797 57798 57799 57800 57801 57802 57803 57804 57805 57806 57807 57808 58314 58315 58316 58318 58320 58323 58325 58328 58330 58332 58663 58664 58665 58666 58667 58668 58670 58671 58674 58675 58676 58677 58678 58679 58680 58681 58682 58683 58684 58685 58687 58688 58689 58690 58865 58868 58874 58881 58886 58891 58903 58908 58914 58918 58920 58922 58941 58945 58949 58954 58957 58960 58961 58962 58966 58969 58976 58977 58979 59015 59016 59019 59023 59026 59029 59031 59034 59038 59041 59046 59047 59050 59053 59513 59518 59608 60578 60579 60581 60583 60584 60585 60632 60633 60634 60676 60711 60712 60714 60715 60716 60717 60718 60719 60781 61089 100655","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

{"id":433,"title":"Present/On the Road to Bazzano","description":"This exhibition featured two groups of large-scale works by one of Americaâs leading contemporary photographers. The culmination of a six-year project photographing the olive orchards and sacred trees of Spoleto, Italy, it revealed JoAnn Verburgâs profound interest in the reciprocity between humans and nature. The exhibition addressed the interrelatedness of life cycles, agriculture, and commerce and the mystery of sacred landscape. The installation reflected a sensitivity to architecture, human scale, and implied and actual timeâ issues more often addressed by installation art, architecture, or theater than by conventional photography. Verburg saw the olive tree, a life form essential to Italian culture, as a powerful metaphor for exchange. She made a gift of these works in her presentation of living cultural icons that do much to stimulate our own wonder and our own relationships with place and with what is sacred in nature.","date":"Friday, March 09, 2001 - Sunday, May 06, 2001","objectId":"45555 45556 45557 45558 45559 45560 45561 45562 45566 45567 45568 45569 45570 45571 45573 45574 45575","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

{"id":435,"title":"Howard Ben TrÃ©: Sculpting Space in the Public Realm","description":"This exhibition focused on the glass sculptor Howard Ben TrÃ©âs public projects for plazas and streetscapes, which are an increasingly important part of his work. A major component of the exhibition was the project recently approved by Target Corporation for their new public plaza in downtown Minneapolis. Howard Ben TrÃ© is a very important player in the studio glass movement that developed in the 1960s and 1970s in Providence, Rhode Island. He has produced sculptures in cast translucent glass, employing an industrial process and medium known to him from working in various trades as a young man. His pieces exhibited extreme control and symmetry, and resembled ancient archeological finds. The sculptures developed as freestanding works that combine totemic forms with light (transmitted and reflected) and water to create a transcendent experience that invites human interaction.

Those advances made in a series of modernist movements, from Arts and Crafts, Art Nouveau, Dadaism, De Stijl, and Russian Constructivism through the Bauhaus, were graphically captured.","date":"Friday, February 09, 2001 - Sunday, January 13, 2002","objectId":"48775 48777 48782 48784 48785 48787 49777 49782 49784 49787 49791 49794 53739 60765","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

Known for his giant wooden machines âthat work in the minds of the viewer,â Chris Larson presented his second film project that uses his sculpture as a theatrical set. As creative director, actor, set designer, and builder, Larsen used poetic themes of Americana and vaudeville to extend his inquiry into metamorphosis, the sacred and profane, or what country western music calls, âSaturday Night/Sunday Morning. In her exhibit, Homo domesticus, Melissa Stang presented two new works. One, a monumental assembled painting that sought to reconcile the expectations she feels as a woman artist; the other, a domestic interior of a mysterious herpetologist filled with kitschy decorative art objects depicting reptiles and amphibians. A table set with three-legged frog patterned plates (all drawn by Stang) reminded us to heed natureâs warnings and pays homage to the humble creatures who have given their lives for âhuman progress.â","date":"Friday, August 03, 2001 - Sunday, September 23, 2001","objectId":"53466 53481","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

{"id":471,"title":"Frontera Lake Street","description":"\"Frontera Lake Street\" was presented through the museum's artist-run curatorial department, the Minnesota Artists Exhibition Program (MAEP), and by \"Grupo Soap del Corazon (\"spanglish\" for \"soap of the heart\"), a group of artists and cultural activists devoted to the promotion of \"border\" culture in Minnesota. Grupo Soap produces and presents an ongoing series of exhibitions and projects that acknowledge, in particular, the Latinization of Lake Street in Minneapolis, with its mercados, taquerias, tortillerias, Latin record stores, nightclubs, boot shops, and salons. The Frontera Six borrowed from Mexican popular culture, each assumed the persona of an imaginary professional wrestler. In creating their own pop-wrestler characters, each Frontera artist invented a distinct personality and stage name, complete with masks and costumes. These theatrical characters worked to advertise the exhibition as well as to reconcile and celebrate \"high\" and \"low\" art. The artwork featured in the gallery installation included tiny landscapes painted on corn, rice, and other seeds by Salvador Espejo Benitez, depicted scenes of Minnesota on one side, and of Mexico, on the other. Luis Fitch's mixed-media work illustrated the opportunities that have drawn Mexicans to Minnesota as well as the risks that they have taken to cross over. A Central American-style trinket cart by Alexa Horochowski was packed with saleable art miniatures including hand-painted surrogate wrestling figures of the Frontera artists themselves. Douglas Padilla's intense symbolist paintings referenced the North and the South, connecting the Mississippi with the desert. Chilean painter Marcela Rodriguez A. was inspired by her Latino students and the landscape of her homeland. Xavier Tavera's large-scale color photographs revealed Latinos as both visible and invisible.","date":"Friday, October 12, 2001 - Sunday, December 02, 2001","objectId":"58373 58377 58399 58400 58401 58402 59072 59074","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

It featured works from a selection of the notable civilizations found throughout North, Central and South America, objects ranging in time of creation from 2500 BC to the initial period of contact with Europeans in the 16th century. These pieces represented a great variety of artistic styles powerfully expressing the fundamental religious, historical and political aspects of the lives of the people who created them. \r\nAll of the approximately 180 objects in the exhibition were selected from the collections of American museums in the FRAME (French Regional American Museums Exchange) consortium and are masterpieces reflecting the strongest works available throughout the United States. Highlights of the show included elegant ceramics decorated with abstract and representational art designs from the Southwestern region of the present United States, as well as refined stone sculptures, ceramics and personal ornaments from the Southeast. Ancient Mexican cultures were represented by the superbly carved jade statues of figures and animals of the Olmec, the expertly painted ceramic vessels illustrating themes from mythology and history, and elaborately carved stone figures created by artists of the Maya civilization, and the inventive ceramic sculptures from the people of the Colima, Nayarit and Jalisco regions representing different aspects of everyday life. From Central America there were magnificent golden ornaments fashioned in the form of human beings, mythological figures and animals, which were used by chiefs and other people of high status to adorn themselves and mark their status.

{"id":495,"title":"Tzedakah Box: The Art of Giving","description":"The Jewish alms container known as the tzedekah box occupies a unique place among Jewish ritual objects. Whereas other religious objects are bound by their ritual purpose, the tzedekah box is unaffiliated. The word tzedekah is derived from the root âtzadekâ, meaning justice or righteousness. Tzedekah is the Jewish commandment to provide for those that are less fortunate as a means of bringing justice to the world. Tzedekah boxes come in all shapes in sizes thereby offering unlimited opportunities for artists to interpret them. The project will send an invitation to local Jewish and non-Jewish artists, inviting them to create a tzedekah box. Approximately 30 winning designs will be displayed at community sites and culminate with an exhibition at The Minneapolis Institute of Arts. The Tzedekah Box Project will challenge viewers/participants to question their own place in society; their responsibilities to their community; and their ability to be social change agents. It will ask us to reflect on ways in which we could have been changed by philanthropy and ways in which our community may have been transformed by anotherâs generosity.","date":"Friday, March 08, 2002 - Sunday, May 19, 2002","objectId":"61113 61114 61115 61116 61117 61118 61136 61137 61138 61139 61140 61141 61276 61277 61278 61279 61280","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}
{"id":496,"title":"High Touch","description":"Artists Laura Stack and Anne Sugnet come to the abundance of the natural world - to its ever-shifting patterns of replication - with great reverence. Both artists have experienced profound events with the physical body and consider making art to be a transcendent action. Through their work they seek to create an antidote to a high speed, high-tech world that operates beyond human pace. Their exhibition \"High Touch\", which features Stack's luminous black and white drawings and Sugnet's intimate mixed-media installations, offers a poetic investigation into the very essence of things. Here we find slow amassed time, things becoming and unbecoming, traces of touch, and tender constellations of forms. In both bodies of work, primordial forms emerge - forms that suggest seeds, cones, spirals, cells dividing, or the cosmos. These shapes are familiar and there is comfort in that re-cognition. Yet they are located in mysterious spaces and for that they do not feel didactic but more like dÃ©jÃ  vu - that fleeting sense of knowing, shrouded in mystery. It seems that you've been here before - perhaps in another life, perhaps as a cell or a star.","date":"Friday, March 01, 2002 - Wednesday, June 05, 2002","objectId":"61246 61247 61248 61249 61250 61251 61252 61253 61255 61256 61257 61258 61725","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

Produced over a sixty-year period, Wrightâs designs range from simple footbridges in rural settings to multi-level, long-span urban bridges for both vehicles and pedestrians.","date":"Saturday, April 06, 2002 - Sunday, July 07, 2002","objectId":"61358 61359","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

After immigrating to the United States in 1937, he practiced architecture with Walter Gropius for a decade before opening his own successful office. His buildings, including the Whitney Museum in New York and Unesco Headquarters in Paris, are as visually arresting as his furniture, and he is regarded as one of the most important modern architect/designers of the twentieth century. âMarcel Breuer in Minnesotaâ is organized by the Minneapolis Institute of Arts to mark the centenary of Breuerâs birth.

Yet all three broker serious ideas that, due to their cultural (or counter-cultural) underpinnings, can seem cautionary, subversive or even sinister. \r\nMollie Rabiner invites the gallery visitor to try their luck with relationships and candy-coated desires by playing her stage-set, coin operated, carnival claw and digger machine. J.J. Peet presents a curious array of fake objects designed to carry extreme value or that allude to some secret information or event. He questions the very nature of art through an assortment of found and handmade props -- bags of money; bricks of gold; a count-down-clock; and a mysterious brief case. Don Myhre presents a weird robotic amalgamation in his interactive sculpture, âRaftâ.

{"id":539,"title":"Household Names: The Designer in American Life","description":"How have Americans become aware of who designs their everyday objects? With the advent of industrial production in the mid-19th century, household goods flooded European and American homes, but they were for the most part unattractive, owing to the little regard manufacturers gave toward their appearance. The 1930s introduced Americans to industrial designers such as Raymond Loewy, Henry Dreyfuss, and Walter Dorwin Teague, who became well known through their streamlined approach to everything from automobiles to thermostats, and through their books on the subject of design. By the 1940s, as consumers began to embrace modern design, manufacturers made a point of marketing goods under the âbrand namesâof their designers. Russel and Mary Wright and Charles and Ray Eames positioned themselves as practitioners of a new, casual lifestyle for which their modern products were perfectly suited. Today, with the faces and signatures of Philippe Starck and Michael Graves prominently featured on packaging, designers are often better known than their merchandise. Through objects from the Instituteâs collection and from private collections, âHousehold Namesâexamines the designerâs rise to recognition in modern Ameerica.","date":"Friday, March 07, 2003 - Sunday, February 29, 2004","objectId":"3551 3553 3555 4026 4197 4198 4980 5135 6954 6957 6964 7105 8375 12806 12831 13092 13099 13100 13101 13102 13103 13104 13105 13106 13107 13108 13109 13110 13111 13112 13113 13116 13117 13118 13121 13124 13125 13127 13128 13131 13132 24762 25357 27070 28533 28535 33605 33606 33607 34860 40245 40246 40247 40248 40249 40250 40251 40261 40263 40264 40265 40266 40267 40268 40269 40270 40271 40272 40273 40274 40275 40276 40277 40290 40293 40294 40300 40301 40307 40309 40325 40597 40873 40874 40875 40876 40877 40925 40941 40942 40943 40944 40945 40956 40957 40988 40989 40990 58170 59558 59559 59560 59561 59562 59589 62638 62641 63728 66013 66014 66403 66404 66405 66408 66409 66457 66458 66459 66460 66461 66462 66463 66464 66465 66466 66467 66486 66487 66488 66489 66490 66491 66492 66493 66494 66495 66496 66497 66498 66500 66501 66502 66503 66636 66649 66650 66651 66652 66653 66654 66655 66656 66657 66658 66659 66660 66661 66664 66665 66666 66668 66669 66670 66671 66672 66673 66674 66675 66676 66677 66678 66679 66680 66681 66682 66683 66684 66685 66686 66687 66688 66689 66690 66691 66695 66696 66697 66702 66703 66704 66705 67047 67048 67049 67050 67051 67052 67053 67054 67055 67062 67063 67065 67066 67067 67068 67070 67071 67072 67073 67463 67464 67465 67466","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

Ingenuity is often synonymous with modernity and such is the case with nearly forty works selected for this exhibition. Are you aware that one of the foremost designers represented in the exhibition, Harold Van Doren, served as Assistant Director of The Minneapolis Institute of Arts?\r\n \r\nComprised of kitchenware drawn from the Instituteâs collection, complemented with additional loans, the works are inventive collaborations between designers, engineers, manufacturers and advertising agents resulting in some of the most remarkable utensils and appliances of the era. The one element missing is the aroma of freshly-brewed coffee, pancakes, maple syrup and crisp bacon. Nevertheless, it is an exhibition for all ages, homemakers or not.","date":"Friday, March 07, 2003 - Sunday, February 29, 2004","objectId":"40604 40605 40967 40976 45648 47056 47057 47719 51353 59626 62524 62695 66189 66190 66191 66192 66193 66194 66195 66196 66197 66198 66199 66200 66201 66205 66208 66210 66211 66212 66635","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

These and other related themes were explored in the works on display. The Romantic era stretched from the French Revolution in 1789 until the middle of the 19th century, with the most intense period of production beginning with the demise of Napoleon in 1815 and progressing until the early 1840s. While many of the artists represented in the exhibition are better known as painters, this exhibition revealed that they were also talented practitioners of lithography and etching. Featured prints included selections from Gericaultâs English Set, J.M.W. Turnerâs Liber Studiorum, and Bonningtonâs views of Paris and Rouen, as well as Delacroixâs Royal Tiger.","date":"Friday, April 04, 2003 - Sunday, October 19, 2003","objectId":"9204 42147 42148 42161 42203 42204 43649 43663 45830 45998 46443 46783 48210 48223 48224 48235 48880 48882 51360 54444 54445 54806 56128 56547 66613 66615","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

{"id":564,"title":"George Washington: A National Treasure","description":"The 205-year-old portrait of George Washington is considered an American treasure compared to that of the Liberty Bell and the Declaration of Independence. It is commonly called the âLansdowneâ portrait, the title derived from the name of the person for whom it was painted, the Marquis of Lansdowne. Senator William Bingham commissioned it in 1796 for the marquis, a British support of the American cause during the American Revolution. The artist is Gilbert Stuart, the preeminent portraitist in the United States in the early 19th century. Stuart painted nearly 1,000 portraits in his lifetime including Paul Revere, Abigail Adams, Mohawk Chief Joseph Brandt as well as George Washington and numerous other U.S. presidents. In spring of 2001 the National Portrait Gallery acquired the âLansdowneâ portrait through a generous gift from the Donald W. Reynolds Foundation.","date":"Friday, August 01, 2003 - Sunday, November 30, 2003","objectId":"80998 80999 81000","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

{"id":575,"title":"Currents of Change: Art and Life Along the Mississippi River, 1850-1861","description":"Americaâs development was at one of its most dramatic moments in the 1850s, a decade celebrated along the Mississippi River as the 50th anniversary of the Louisiana Purchase and the westward expedition of Lewis and Clark. Currents of Change will explore the fine and decorative arts along the river during that period. America was undergoing extraordinary changes: from the steamboat era to the advent of the railroad, from a mostly agrarian economy to the beginnings of the industrial revolution, from a nation of youthful optimism to one which would soon erupt into civil war. Fortunes made from lumber and lead processing in the North and cotton and sugar production in the South gave birth to the great cities along the river that we know today, and financed the demand for sophisticated furnishings and a ârefinedâ life. The Mississippi, which had long been a channel for trade, was becoming an important conduit for ideas about art, culture, and design.\r\nCurrents of Change brings together approximately 175 objects in all media: paintings, prints, and drawings, furniture, silver, ceramics, textiles, and sculpture. The exhibition includes a 16-foot segment from the only extant panorama of the Mississippi River (a 340-foot-long moving landscape), to be shown in a theatrical setting that recalls how viewers of the 1850s would have seen it.\r\nAn illustrated catalogue accompanies the exhibition.","date":"Sunday, June 27, 2004 - Sunday, September 25, 2005","objectId":"356 687 727 3581 6335 6336 12832 13020 13091 19376 25289 25293 25294 25295 25297 25305 25326 25342 25351 36167 36169 36170 36179 71418 81074 82770 83464 83888 83889 83894 83972 83973 89293 89294 89295 89945 90702 90703 90704 90705 90706 90707 90709 90711 90712 90714 90716 90717 90718 90719 90720 90721 90722 90801 90804 90805 90806 90807 90808 90809 90810 90811 90830 90831 90832 90833 90834 90836 90949 90950 91208 91209 91211 91247 91256 91262 91263 91264 91265 91266 91269 91295 91298 91302 91307 91308 91310 91314 91316 91320 91326 91328 91330 91333 91335 91336 91337 91339 91347 91365 91366 91367 91368 91369 91370 91371 91375 91376 91377 91378 91379 91380 91381 91382 91399 91416 91417 91418 91419 91420 91421 91422 91423 91424 91425 91426 91427 91428 91429 91430 91431 91432 91433 91434 91435 91436 91437 91438 91439 91440 91441 91442 91443 91444 91446 91448 91459 91461 91463 91467 91470 91488 91489 91490 91494 91495 91496 91498 91500 91501 91503 91505 91506 91508 91509 91510 91511 91512 91513 91515 91516 91517 91519 91520 91521 91522 91523 91524 91525 91530 91532 91533 91534 91535 91557 91558 91559 91560 91561 91562 91563 91564 91565 91566 91567 91568 91569 91570 91571 91572 91573 91574 91575 91576 91577 91578 91579 91580 91581 91582 91583 91584 91585 91586 91587 91588 91610 91611 91612 91613 91614 91615 91616 91617 91618 91619 91620 91621 91622 91623 91624 91625 91626 91627 91628 91629 91630 91631 91632 91633 91634 91635 91636 91637 91638 91639 91641 91642 91643 91644 91645 91646 91716 91717 91718 91719 91720 91785 91794 91810 91812 91815 91818 91821 91822 91823 91824 91825 91829 91839 91845 91849 91866 94719 94720 95613 95614 95615","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}
{"id":576,"title":"Beauford Delaney: From New York to Paris","description":"Beauford Delaney, an African-American, was an artist who produced works of great diversity and technical complexity who has, unfortunately, remained relatively unknown to the general public. While his pursuit of art began in his native Knoxville, Tennessee, and continued over a five-year period in Boston, the years that followed (1929-1979) were the most innovative and productive of the artistâs life. His career is generally broken into two parts: the New York Years (1929-1953), during which time Delaney produced his colorful and highly-engaging compositions of the Cityâs urban landscape; and the Paris years (1953-1979) when the artist, known as âthe dean of American Negro paintersâ in Paris, embraced abstract expressionism in a study of color and light. The Instituteâs presentation, for the first time, provides a survey of the progression of his work. The exhibition brings forth transitional works that have not previously been considered and illuminate his place within American art history. The exhibition consists of approximately forty paintings and ten works on paper borrowed from institutional and private collections in America and Europe.","date":"Saturday, November 20, 2004 - Saturday, January 28, 2006","objectId":"6313 7034 49206 61865 61866 67499 81480 81481 81482 81483 83066 83070 83071 89233 89234 89235 89236 89338 90948 91487 92644 95420 95683 95684 95685 95907 95928 95929 95930 95931 95934 95978 95981 95982 95983 95984 95986 95987 95988 95989 95990 95991 95992 95993 95994 97673","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}
{"id":577,"title":"Holiday Traditions 2004-2005","description":"Packages of all sorts have come a long way since the plain brown bundles depicted in Victorian Christmas scenes. Advances in construction, printing, and mechanization throughout the 20th century have resulted in âgraphicâ developments for the simple shopping bag and hatbox. They serves as portable billboards for the store, and once home, can live on as containers for keepsakesâoften becoming keepsakes themselves. As department stores and boutiques increasingly consider packaging as an extension of their service and identity, they look to designers for more attractive wrappings. Artists such as ErtÃ©, Roy Lichtenstein, Salvador Dali, Andy Warhol, and Frank Stella have accepted commissions to design shopping bags, many of them considered portable art by museums and collectors. \r\nIn the Twin Cities, such fashion-forward retailers as Young-Quinlan, Field-Schlick, and Daytonâs invested considerable effort and imagination into their packaging. The Institute will feature these and other designs from local shops in the Bell Decorative Arts Court during this yearâs Holiday Traditions exhibition, on view in the Period Rooms and at the Purcell-Cutts house November 26, 2004 through January 2, 2005. Costumed docents will offer tours from Thanksgiving through New Yearâs Eve.","date":"Friday, November 26, 2004 - Sunday, January 02, 2005","objectId":"6186 6188 6190 6192 33275 33276 33450 33451 33452 33453 33454 33455 33456 33457 33458 33459 33460 33461 33462 33463 33464 33465 33466 33467 33468 33475 33476 33477 33478 33480 33485 33486 33487 33488 33490 33495 33496 33497 33499 33500 33501 33502 33503 33507 33512 33513 33516 33581 33637 38895 38897 38898 41049 60160 63536 63537 63538 83503 83524 83529 83530 83531 83532 83533 91453 95422 95740 95776 95777 95778 95779 95780 95781 95782 95783 95784 95785 95786 95789 95790 95791 95792 95793 95794 95795 95796 95797 95798 95799 95800 95817 95818 95827 95828 95932 95933 95935 95938 95939 95940 95941 98509 98510 98511 98512 101340 101341 101342 101343 101344 101345 101346 101347 101348 101349 101357","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

{"id":590,"title":"Untamed Beauty: Tigers in Japanese Art","description":"The tiger figures prominently in Asian mythology, where it is identified with yin, the female principle, as well as autumn, wind, and the west. Artists often paired images of tigers with their cosmological cousin, the dragon (identified with yang, the male principle, spring, rain, and the east). Although tigers are not indigenous to Japan, their absence engendered great interest in them and spurred fanciful ideas about their nature and physical form. The earliest Japanese images of tigers date to as early as the 6th century, but the subject became a staple theme of artists from the 13th century onwards. Some artists pictured ferocious beasts in windswept bamboo; others rendered tigers as overgrown housecats. This exhibition explores the great breadth of tiger painting through the fertile imaginations of twenty-one Japanese artists. \r\nFrom 1959 until 1964, Edson Spencer was Far East regional manager for Honeywell International in Tokyo. While in Japan, both he and his wife, Harriet, became enamored with Japanese art and amassed an important collection of folk painting. This collection was featured in the museumâs 1994 exhibition Ãtsu-e: Japanese Folk Paintings. \r\nBorn in the âyear of the tigerâ Edson Spencer purchased his first tiger painting while living in Japan. Since then, his collection has grown to include 21 hanging scrolls and a magnificent pair of folding screens. Artists include many of Japanâs most famous painters of the last three hundred years, including Tawaraya Sotatsu, Maruyama Okyo, Nagasawa Rosetsu, Kano Tsunenobu, and Kishi Ganku","date":"Saturday, March 05, 2005 - Sunday, March 08, 2009","objectId":"22593 22679 42447 45653 63799 63800 68913 78112 78144 78175 78193 78194 78231 78266 78311 78314 78320 78611 78612 78613 78614 78615 78616 78617 78618 78619 78620 78621 78622 78623 78624 78630 89686 96009","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

Also included are images of the New York nightclub scene of the 1970s, fashion shows, and other displays of vanity and public preening. The photographs evoke an amusing though gently caustic, tongue-in-cheek satire on how we present ourselves to the world.","date":"Saturday, May 04, 2002 - Thursday, December 18, 2003","objectId":"13303 13306 13311 13314 13318 13320 13322 13327 13330 13331 13332 13334 13336 13338 13638 13644 13646 13655 13659 13678 33949 33955 33956 33964 33972 33973 33975 33976 33977 33978 33987 33988 33989 33993 59615 59629 59630 59633 59670 59673 59679 59682 59717 59756 59757 59759 59760 59761 59762 59781 59785 59791 59792 59793 59794 59795 59796 59797 59798 59799 59803 59804 59819 59820 59823 59825 59826 59827 59828 59989 59993 59995 59996 59997 59998","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

This exhibition celebrated the career and life of this extraordinary artist. The Minneapolis Institute of Arts has over 100 etchings and lithographs by Whistler that formed the core of the exhibition. As an etcher, Whistler took inspiration from Rembrandt and the Dutch masters that he discovered in the print collection of his brother in law, Francis Seymour Haden. Works by these artists were on view, allowing the visitor to see the path of Whistler's development as a printmaker. Whistler was a charismatic and challenging personality whose art and ideas influenced numerous other artists. This exhibition also included works by those who were members of Whistler's circle of admirers and followers, allowing the visitor to see the wide path Whistler cut across the art world. His influence was not only seen in the prints and paintings of the day, but also in the interiors and decorative arts his gathered around him. The exhibition was augmented by a selection of decorative arts, Japanese prints, and other objects that would have graced a Whisterian interior. The exhibition cut across numerous curatorial departments to create a stunning picture of the world of James Abbott McNeill Whistler.","date":"Saturday, December 06, 2003 - Sunday, March 28, 2004","objectId":"190 4452 4890 7381 7382 7383 7384 7385 7386 7387 7388 7389 7390 7391 7392 7393 7395 7396 7397 7398 7399 7400 7401 7402 7403 7404 7405 7406 7407 7425 7476 7664 7666 12877 15483 15650 22477 23857 24325 42201 42257 47144 47145 52896 52897 52898 52900 52902 52905 52906 52913 52920 52926 52931 52934 52935 52936 52938 52940 52942 52986 52987 52988 52989 52997 52999 53000 53006 53007 53008 53012 53074 53082 53084 53085 53088 53089 53090 53091 53092 53095 53096 53098 53102 53103 53104 53105 53111 53112 53115 53116 53118 53119 53120 53126 53131 53132 53135 53139 53142 53143 53145 53152 53163 53165 53166 53168 57048 58105 62041 63443 83375 83468 83648 83672 83673 83674 83675 83748 83848","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

{"id":626,"title":"The Twin Cities Collects: The Ceramics of Edwin and Mary Scheier","description":"Americans Edwin and Mary Scheier (b. 1910 and b. 1908) took a circuitous route to the world of pottery, by way of art school, odd jobs, puppeteering, and positions with the Works Progress Administration during the 1930s. By 1940 their lively pots of Virginia clay won awards at the prestigious Ceramic National at Syracuse, New York. As a result, Ed was offered a teaching position at the University of New Hampshire, where he and Mary produced hundreds of beautifully potted wares often decorated with Edâs expressive human figures or abstract sgraffito decoration. In the late 1960s, the Scheiersâ move to Mexico resulted in exciting work in new media including weaving design and wooden sculpture. After the Scheiers settled in Arizona in 1978, Ed returned with renewed vigor to clay and has over the past several years created original computer art. This exhibition, celebrated the wealth of work by the Scheiers in local public and private collections, included approximately forty-five ceramic pieces, as well as other objects in a variety of media from their 60-plus years as a creative team.","date":"Saturday, December 13, 2003 - Sunday, April 11, 2004","objectId":"6715 6716 6717 6768 83534 83540 83541 83542 83543 83544 83545 83546 83547 83548 83549 83550 83551 83552 83553 83554 83555 83556 83557 83558 83559 83560 83561 83562 83565 83566 83567 83568 83569 83570 83571 83572 83573 83574 83575 83576 83577 83578 83582 83583 83584 83585 83586 83587 83588 83589","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

{"id":647,"title":"Just One Word: PLASTICS","description":"\"I just want to say one word to you. Just one word....Plastics.... There's a great future in plastics.\" This brief pronouncement appearing in the 1968 film, \"The Graduate,\" convulsed audiences then, but since has taken on an entirely new meaning. In the span of some 35 years, the entire spectrum of plastics â that \"miracle material\" â has risen from ridicule to respect (occasionally reverence) and, yet again, a scourge-like contempt when it comes to matters of biodegradable disposal.\r\nIn a two-part examination and celebration of innovative plastic design, a first installment will appear in Wells Fargo Gallery of The Minneapolis Institute of Arts followed by a second, overlapping presentation at Wells Fargo Center in downtown Minneapolis. It is the first such arrangement utilizing the city-center facility to expand on a given theme originating at the Institute.\r\nToday, nothing underscores the technological revolution more than plastics. Not since the early 20-century popularity of Bakelite (which will be featured in a simultaneous Institute installation as part of the on-going \"Case Studies\" Series) has plastic been so admired. Tutti-frutti colors, sensuous, tactile surfaces, transparent forms, groovy fusions of art and chemistry, and phenomenal tensile strength are but a few of the qualities fulfilling design needs beyond mere function. In the 21st century, functionality has become multi-dimensional and plastics appear to promise ever-expanding purpose and pleasure.","date":"Saturday, March 06, 2004 - Sunday, February 27, 2005","objectId":"83465 84208 84209 84210 84211 84212 84213 84214 84215 84216 84217 84218 84219 84220 84221 84222 84223 84224 84225 84226 84227 84228 84229 84230 84231 84232 84233 84234 84235 84236 84237 84238 84239 84240 84241 84242 84243 84244 84245 84246 84247 84248 84249 84250 84251 84252 84253 84254 84255 84256 84257 84258 84259 84260 84261 84262 84263 84264 84265 84266 84267 84268 84269 84270 84271 84273 84274 84275 84276 84277 84278 84279 84280 84281 84282 84283 84284 84285 84286 84287 84288 84289 84290 84291 84292 84293 84294 84295 89296 89297 89298 89299 89300 89301 89311 89312 89313 89314 89315 89396 89397 89398 89495","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

{"id":659,"title":"Bakelite: Art through Chemistry","description":"While plastic is considered a \"now\" medium, the modern plastics industry stretches back to the 1920s and the mass production of Bakelite. Its potential was first developed in 1907 by Dr. Leo Hendrik Baekeland (1863-1944), now regarded as the \"Father of Plastics.\" As a simultaneous complement to the Institute's \"Just One Word: PLASTICS\" exhibition, \"Bakelite: Art Through Chemistry\" will be on view concurrently, from March 6 to February 27, 2005. The latter is a continuation of the museum's \"Case Studies in Design\" series. \r\nSignificantly, Bakelite has earned the distinction of being the world's very first totally synthetic, thermosetting plastic. It quickly found its way into homes and offices in a wide assortment of objects, many represented in this exhibition, ranging from kitchenware, household and office wares, to electronics, cameras, tools and jewelry. \"Its versatility extended from cradle to grave\" boasted advertisements in 1939.\r\nMolten Bakelite flowed evenly and gave rise to the smooth, \"streamline\" style so pervasive in the l930s. At that time the ideological thrust of Modernism stressed the importance of new materials such as Bakelite and, in turn, plastics became firmly associated with the ideals and spread of modern design.","date":"Saturday, March 06, 2004 - Sunday, February 27, 2005","objectId":"12997 40279 40280 40292 40296 40325 53180 55601 60162 61438 62811 84189 84190 84191 84192 84194 84195 84196 84197 84198 84199 84200 84201 84202 84203 84204 84205 84206 84207 84216 84289","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

The fifteenth-century Netherlandish painterâso named for the delicately patterned and crisply executed blades of grass and plants that resemble embroidery in his paintingsâis best known for his panel paintings of the Virgin and Child with a book. Virtually identical in composition, these works feature Mary in voluminous robes sitting on a throne while the Christ child in her arms leafs precociously through the pages of an illuminated manuscript. The Masterâs panels differ in their settings and other decorative details, however. Some feature landscape backgrounds while others show city streets. Angels, peacocks, or contemporary burghers embellish the pictures alternatively. Rich in palette and pattern, the panels are finely painted with an eye for detail characteristic of Northern Renaissance painters of this era, which include Rogier van der Weyden (c. 1399-1464), upon whose works the Masterâs are based. An illustrated catalogue will be published on the occasion of the exhibition.","date":"Saturday, October 09, 2004 - Sunday, July 10, 2005","objectId":"4035 15453 96319 96320 96321","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

{"id":677,"title":"Hot & Cool: The Jazz Posters of Niklaus Troxler","description":"An extensive suite of dramatic jazz posters by the Swiss graphic designer, Niklaus Troxler, will be presented in the U.S. Bank Gallery. Drawn from a collection of post-war posters acquired by Norwest Corporation in 1991, they exemplify the celebrated Swiss International Style initiated decades earlier. Thelonious Monk, McCoy Tyner, Alvin Jones, Arthur Blythe, the Roscoe Mitchell Quartet and Sam Rivers Quartet are but a few of the influential jazz musicians represented. \r\nNiklaus Troxler (b. 1947) is best known for his striking posters for the Jazz festival at Willisau, Switzerland. He studied at the Kunstgewerbeschule, Lucerne (1968-71) and worked briefly as art director at Hollenstein Creation in Paris before founding his own studio in Willisau in 1973. Troxler has been the recipient of numerous design awards, but his work to date is little known in America.\r\nIn their small hometown of Willisau, Troxler and his brother founded a jazz festival in 1975 which soon became world famous. Ever since, Troxler has remained the most prolific and talented of jazz posters artists. While there have been many jazz festivals over the years, none have produced a series of graphics that compare with Troxlerâs memorable design. He continues to work in a select field heâs made his own.\r\nPictorial simplicity, bold color fields, rational order, compressed spatial compositions and innovative letterforms are among the qualities that distinguish this group of jazz posters. Clarity and immediacy are the two key ingredients conveyed in multilingual formats meant to transcend language and cultural barriers.\r\nThe Swiss poster movement had a decisive impact on postwar American graphic design, spreading a new âinternationalismâ in the print world. This cohesive set of posters represents a convergence of two distinct sensibilities: American improvisational jazz and the cerebral order of Swiss graphic design.","date":"Saturday, November 20, 2004 - Sunday, February 06, 2005","objectId":"94068 94163 94164 94165 94166 94167 94168 94169 94170 94171 94172 94173 94174 94175 94270 94276 94281 94284 94285 94286 94287 94288 94289 94292 94294 94296 95908 95909","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

In a series of thematically related works, Stevens explores the concept of an enduring universal consciousness that she believes underlies all human experience. She reveals her own spiritual connection to the world through the depiction of luminous bodies of water â aquatic landscapes â which often feature abstracted sequences of words extracted from texts ranging from Virginia Wolff to Irish poetry of the 5th century BCE. These text fragments serve as memetic cues â reminders of a common human spirituality. For Stevens, these poetic and highly personal works of art evoke a sense of continuance, connection between people, and the transient nature of time, place and life.","date":"Saturday, June 11, 2005 - Sunday, April 02, 2006","objectId":"5745 95238 97684 97733","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

{"id":716,"title":"San Francisco Psychedelic","description":"During the mid-1960s psychedelic music emerged in San Francisco as a distinctive and internationally influential sound. Bands with roots in blues and folk music improvised and jammed freely, allowed their songs to go on at length, and utilized unusual sounds such as feedback. This music was central to the American counter-culture (âhippieâ) movement, spawning freeform dance concerts, flashing light shows, and psychedelic posters. Among the leading groups were Big Brother & the Holding Company (featuring Janis Joplin), Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, and Steve Miller Band.\r\nPhotographers easily integrated themselves into the psychedelic music scene. They made portraits of the musicians in the controlled settings of their studios, captured band members on the streets of the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood (where most of them lived), and photographed the frequent and energetic live performances. A handful of talented photographers made iconic images of the bands that were used in magazines, posters, and on album covers. Prominent among them were Herb Greene, Jim Marshall, Bob Seidemann, and Thomas Weir.","date":"Saturday, February 10, 2007 - Sunday, June 10, 2007","objectId":"12697 19489 52525 52527 52529 52532 52644 59749 59754 60596 60839 60840 60841 60843 60845 61271 61554 61556 61557 61558 61563 62097 62099 81012 81013 81014 94816 97089 97090 97091 97092 97093 97094 97095 97096 97097 97098 97099 97100 97101 97102 97103 97104 97105 97106 99793 99794 99795 101086 101087 101088 101089 101090 101091 101092 101093 101094 101095 101096 101097 101098 101157 101158 101159 101160 101161 101724 101725 101726 101727 101728 101729 101730 101731 101732 101733 101734","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

Lindner maintains an obsessive relationship with the body and gender and considers many of the puppet-like figures she creates to be surrogates or self-portraits. Selski paintings merge some of the qualities and pictorial traditions of Flemish masterpieces with images of myth and reality. Her ghost-like figures play out layered and mysterious narratives leading the viewer through a maze of awareness, accentuating history, ambiguity and melancholia.

{"id":728,"title":"Georgia O'Keeffe: Circling Around Abstraction","description":"From her earliest mature works to her final paintings â over the course of a career spanning more than seven decades â Georgia OâKeeffe consistently incorporated circular forms into her compositions. Her use of this motif stands in contrast to strategies of abstraction adopted by many of her peers, which tended to be Cubist-based, using straight lines and angles rather than curves and circles. Using the circle and its kin-the ellipse, the oval, and the arcing line-OâKeeffe explored the shifting terrain between abstraction and representation, sometimes calling upon such forms to represent a mood, a reaction to a sensation, or the spiritual essence of a subject, while at other times using them to encourage her viewers to see new relationships between familiar objects. As she developed her unique pictorial vision, OâKeeffe looked to a wide variety of sources, ranging from the theories of Arthur Wesley Dow and Wassily Kandinsky to the work of her American peers, Asian art, and contemporary photography, constantly seeking inspiration and new ideas, but consistently integrating what she learned into a visual language that was, finally, a highly personal and thoroughly innovative contribution to American Modernism.\r\nDespite OâKeeffeâs broad popularity and the numerous exhibitions devoted to her work both during her lifetime and posthumously, Georgia OâKeeffe: Circling Around Abstraction is the first exhibition devoted to this aspect of her work, and promises to make an important addition to scholarship on both OâKeeffe and twentieth-century American art.

{"id":742,"title":"Villa America: American Moderns 1900-1950","description":"Villa America: American Moderns, 1900-1950, organized by Elizabeth Armstrong, Orange County Museum of Art Deputy Director for Programs and Chief Curator, is drawn from the collection of Curtis Galleries, Inc., founder Myron Kunin, and will present over 85 paintings and sculptures from this collection to the public for the first time. The exhibition begins with a look at key American modernists working in Europe and New York during the first quarter of the 20th century. In these early years, artists such as Stuart Davis, Charles Demuth, Arthur Dove, Marsden Hartley, Gerald Murphy, and Georgia O'Keeffe, to name just a few, were reshaping our view of American art. In the early 1900s many of these artists traveled abroad, where they embraced experimentation to transform traditional subject matter into avant-garde statements of personal expression. After World War I, as New York began to eclipse Europe as the destination for creative people, American artists returned, and many artists from abroad moved to New York. \r\nThis extended period of artistic innovation largely came to an end in the 1930s, after the stock market crash, followed by a more sober, realistic mode, with themes reflecting regional values and a new sense of social responsibility. Artists such as Romare Bearden, Paul Cadmus, Philip Evergood, Philip Guston, Reginald Marsh, and Ben Shahn celebrated an 'American Scene' creating powerful images of everyday American life. In the 1930s and 1940s American Regionalists John Curry and Grant Wood championed a nationalistic art that celebrated agrarian values and the search for American roots. George Ault, Charles Sheeler, and Niles Spencer, among others, returned to a form of classical realism to celebrate the American landscape in their paintings of the period.\r\nIn addition to offering a chronological overview of American modern art, Villa America will also include a selection of major figurative works by such American masters as Milton Avery, Robert Henri, Walt Kuhn, and Andrew Wyeth.

From that earliest period he traveled and photographed widely on assignment for publication. His numerous and diverse books indicate the breadth and geographical extent of his work. The Near and Far East, India, Angor, Nepal, BÃ©narÃ¨s, Cambodia, Shaanxi, China, the Soviet Union, North and South Vietnam, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Alaska, the U.S., Mexico, and his native country France. He has been witness to numerous wars and the repressed years of Chairman Maoâs Cultural Revolution in the course of his many and frequent trips to China. He was one of the first western photographers permitted to enter China since the 1949 Cultural Revolution. Highly sensitive to the nuances and subtleties of cultural variations, his photographs provide insightful and memorable vignettes of our rich, complex, and diverse world. He has twice won the coveted Overseas Press Club Award (1967 and again in 1971). This is a retrospective spanning the illustrious career of one of the great French photojournalist of the 20th century.

As it grew in popularity, so too did its specialized bowls, ladles, cups, glasses, and mugs made of ceramic, silver, or glass. The Institute will feature punch bowls from the 18th-20th centuries in the Bell Decorative Arts Court during this yearâs Holiday Traditions exhibition, on view in the Period Rooms and at the Purcell-Cutts.

The exhibition consists of 64 objects: paintings, drawings, engravings, textiles, photographs as well as some of Huntâs letters and memorabilia. \r\nThis exhibition looks at the origins of Huntâs vision, which is rooted in the economic, cultural and spiritual milieu of Victorian England. His concern about contemporary moral and spiritual dilemmas is articulated through works that focus on the theme of spiritual, intellectual, or emotional enlightenment. He is especially interested in moments of insight or revelation, which have the power to change the lives of individuals or the course of the civilized world. The questions that Hunt dealt with in his own times are still relevant today. This is a Hunt for the 21st century, and audiences are able to see how many of our contemporary dilemmas were ones with which Hunt and his contemporaries struggled.\r\nHuntâs secular themes, particularly those featuring women and the relationship between the sexes, reflect his personal experience and have special resonance for modern audiences. His marriage to his deceased wife's sister, who cared for his motherless son, placed him beyond the pale in Britain where such marriages were illegal. He campaigned successfully for a change in the law but never lived to benefit from it.\r\nHuntâs religious subjects captured the High Victorian imagination, and struck an evangelical chord around the world. His vision was disseminated by means of engravings produced after his paintings. The Light of the World, Huntâs allegorical painting of Jesus, actually circumnavigated the globe on protracted tours. The painting drew immense crowds, gave rise to miraculous claims, aesthetic debate, and inspired the manufacture of large numbers of stained glass windows.

Classically trained in Chinese ink painting, Yangâs earliest influences include the mythology and philosophy of his homeland China; and later, the visions of modern western masters such as Picasso and Marini. Yangâs figurative images express the wholeness of his experience with nature, creating mystical atmospheres and places âwhere the viewer has never been before.â Very Taoist in their sensibility, Yangâs paintings are occupied with mysterious animals and humans, who defy any singular narrative. Yang suggests that animals see us far better than we see ourselves, and considers their wisdom (and our blindness to it) to be very significa.nt things","date":"Friday, April 07, 2006 - Sunday, July 23, 2006","objectId":"99507 99508 99509 99510 99511 99512 99513 99514 99515 99516 99517","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

His kinesthetic âdrawingsâ or âpaintingsâ animate the picture plane and allude to myriad inspirations â graffiti, digital technology, contemporary graphic design, and computer animation. Kaniess brings all â over abstraction squarely into the 21st century through images that he draws and paints on used record albums and expanses of billboard vinyl.

{"id":772,"title":"Print Me Once, Print Me Twice","description":"Creative photographers have great latitude when printing their work from their negatives. They choose paper type and size, they can crop the picture differently, and they can alter the tones and contrast of the image, to name only a few options. Photographers use such techniques to maximize their creative impulse and best convey their message. But, over time, many photographic artists interpret a particular negative in different ways, challenging their viewers to become connoisseurs. Only by seeing prints from the same negative, side by side, can one fully appreciate their differences and, perhaps, choose the most fully realized object. Among the most striking examples are prints of vastly different sizes, silver prints and photogravures of the same image, and vintage versus modern prints. This exhibition, drawn almost entirely from the Institute's permanent collection, will include about 80 photographs, spanning the entire twentieth century. Among those represented are Ansel Adams, Walker Evans, Lee Friedlander, Gertrude Kasebier, Alfred Stieglitz, and Edward Weston.","date":"Saturday, November 04, 2006 - Sunday, January 21, 2007","objectId":"1922 2211 2544 3297 8443 10582 10635 10643 11204 11377 11571 11573 11603 11662 11727 11745 11746 12953 19369 19662 19882 19949 20027 20089 20111 20671 21110 21152 22818 24211 24219 25511 25708 25769 26175 26237 27306 31925 31926 34503 37745 58057 58058 81174 81523 81534 82832 82868 82889 99110 99111 99316 99619 99620 100479 100480 100539 100540 100854 101034","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

His company was among the first to produce cloth to compliment the architects who championed the Modernist Movement. He then moved forward to enhance the refined aesthetic of the last part of the century through the use of natural as well as synthetic fibers and a variety of technical innovations. This gallery is dedicated to the display of materials from the Jack Lenor Larsen Company Archive that was acquired by the museum in 1999. The acquisition was particularly noteworthy because for five decades the company was renowned for its international leadership in the field of contemporary interiors textiles. Selections from the companyâs production lines have been the subject of numerous museum exhibitions from Bostonâs Museum of Fine Arts to the Louvreâs museum of decorative arts in Paris. With the MIAâs holding of the entire achieve we are able to examine the material in greater depth than has been possible in the past and share with the museum visitor new insights as well as showing pieces that never went into formal production.\r\nDrawing on the company archive of almost 4000 pieces this series of four rotations focuses on the function of the design studio and the roll of four designers whose distinctive talents played a major roll in the companyâs aesthetic development. Two of these designers, Mark Pollack and Lori Witzner now head their own companies and the rotations highlighting their contributions to the Larsen Design Studio will also include pieces from their current work.","date":"Sunday, June 11, 2006 - Sunday, January 28, 2007","objectId":"24816 84681 84734 84984 85449 85451 85459 85462 85866 86328 86345 86366 86370 86678 86680 87215 87499 87880 88085 88092 88094 88095 88101 88103 88116 88122 88801 88802 88936 88958 89047 89063 99680 99681","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

{"id":776,"title":"Improbable Expressions: Jack Lenor Larsen's Psychedelic Prints","description":"The company developed by Jack Lenor Larsen has long been known for its distinctive interiors textiles that exalt the wonder of natural fibers and highlight their unique textures. However the Larsen design studio has never been limited by stereotypes and in the mid 60âs they created a line of clothing fabric under the JaeL label of dramatic prints on a synthetic knit, the new wonder fabric of that decade. Colors were often bright and demanded attention while patterns ranged from abstract to figural repetitions of exotic birds and animals such as tigers and leopards. The JaeL line received considerable acclaim but production demands in the fashion world differed so greatly from the creation of interiors fabrics, which were the focus of the company, that the line was discontinued after 3 years. Buried within the companyâs archives, these textiles have not been seen for decades and it is the first time they have been highlighted in a museum.

His paintings are apocalyptic in the most dynamic senseâin Munozâs world revelation can serve as an alchemical flashpoint.

{"id":800,"title":"The Surreal Calder","description":"Alexander Calder is a ubiquitous presence in the story of modern art, and yet he is rarely seen in the context from which he initially emerged as an artist. His artistic parentage consisted of Marcel Duchamp, who provided the name of and concept for the mobile, Mondrian who introduced pure abstraction to him, and MirÃ³ who communicated the central thesis of Surrealism. âThe Surreal Calder,â consisting of seventy works including thirteen paintings and objects by artists other than Calder, will put Calder back in the midst of Surrealism so that his achievement is more profoundly understood within that context. The exhibition is conceived of as a suite of six distinct galleries. The first gallery will include works by MirÃ³, Max Ernst, Yves Tanguy, RenÃ© Magritte and will delineate the Surrealist milieu and its chief aspects. In the following galleries themes will explore Calderâs relationship to that milieu during his early years, culminating in 1947 with the theoretical end date of Surrealism. Those works show Calderâs wit, caricature, and linear flights of fancy, his âmarvelous,â in the Surrealist sense of that word, personages â fantastic, never before seen, creatures, poetic constructions of unlikely materials, biomorphic forms from an imaginary vision of nature and Calderâs constellations; apparent views of celestial space. The film âCalderâs Circusâ runs continuously in a gallery inside the exhibition. Made in 1961, this 19-minute color film shows Alexander Calder at work. A fully illustrated catalogue accompanies the exhibition.","date":"Sunday, June 11, 2006 - Sunday, September 10, 2006","objectId":"1318 5033 101055","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

Invented in the late nineteenth century, it has been used since then by creative photographers interested in the rich, continuous tones of this intaglio process. Alfred Stieglitz illustrated his landmark periodical âCamera Workâ with photogravures by Frederick H. Evans, Gertrude KÃ¤sebier, and others intent upon proving the artistic value of photography. From 1907 to 1930 Edward Curtis used the process to produce his mammoth and unrivaled record, âThe North American Indian.â Paul Strandâs most significant portfolio, sensitively depicting Mexican culture, was printed in photogravure. And contemporary photographers such as Carrie Mae Weems and Bernice Ficek-Swenson also warmly embrace the process. The exhibition featured about 75 photogravures, all from the permanent collection of The Minneapolis Institute of Arts.","date":"Saturday, July 14, 2001 - Sunday, November 11, 2001","objectId":"1706 1712 1716 1927 3105 3494 3496 3497 3498 3603 3605 3612 3619 3917 3919 3921 3922 4520 5206 5207 5258 5699 5702 5703 5704 5709 7955 10521 10567 10581 10953 11017 11018 11019 11215 11440 11447 11448 11699 11889 13429 13430 13431 13432 13436 19339 19340 19341 19344 19346 19350 19355 19368 19514 19593 25073 45845 45847 64329 80563 81849 82520 82605","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

His company was among the first to produce cloth to compliment the architects who championed the Modernist Movement. He then moved forward to enhance the refined aesthetic of the last part of the century through the use of natural as well as synthetic fibers and a variety of technical innovations. This gallery is dedicated to the display of materials from the Jack Lenor Larsen Company Archive that was acquired by the museum in 1999. The acquisition was particularly noteworthy because for five decades the company was renowned for its international leadership in the field of contemporary interiors textiles. Selections from the companyâs production lines have been the subject of numerous museum exhibitions from Bostonâs Museum of Fine Arts to the Louvreâs museum of decorative arts in Paris. With the MIAâs holding of the entire achieve we are able to examine the material in greater depth than has been possible in the past and share with the museum visitor new insights as well as showing pieces that never went into formal production.\r\nDrawing on the company archive of almost 4000 pieces this series of four rotations focuses on the function of the design studio and the roll of four designers whose distinctive talents played a major roll in the companyâs aesthetic development.

{"id":822,"title":"Peter Henry Emerson and American Naturalistic Photography","description":"Peter Henry Emerson (1856-1936) was a leading nineteenth-century English photographer who spearheaded a style he termed ânaturalistic photography.â He argued for photography as a fine art, encouraged his colleagues to use nature as their standard, and introduced the theory of âdifferential focusing,â whereby the main subject was in focus and everything else fell off into moderate softness.\r\nMany young Americans admired Emersonâs work, forming a movement of naturalistic photography in this country that lasted from the 1890s to about 1930. Like Emerson, they emphasized the beauty of Mother Nature and humankindâs harmony with her. They photographed the land in all its seasons, as well as the devoted individuals who lived on and off it. \r\nThis exhibition was organized by the Minneapolis Institute of Arts and comprises 90 photographs, drawn largely from the permanent collection. Among those represented are Edward Curtis, Rudolf Eickemeyer, Alfred Stieglitz, and Doris Ulmann. The show is accompanied by the first major book on the subject and will travel to museums in University Park, Pennsylvania, and Roanoke, Virginia.","date":"Saturday, May 03, 2008 - Sunday, August 16, 2009","objectId":"145 146 147 148 150 193 2058 2073 3603 3612 3616 3918 3922 11226 11281 11282 11283 11284 11503 11504 12902 12903 12904 12905 12907 12909 12910 12911 12912 45845 45847 57628 57629 57630 59624 59625 60850 61270 62053 62060 62063 62070 62111 71989 89351 89367 89379 89380 89482 94812 94814 97640 97641 98192 98193 98194 98196 98198 98199 98418 99314 99320 99340 99761 99762 101751 101755 102832 103083 103084 103211 103637 103682 103683 104219 104220 104221 104222 105862 105863 105864 105865 105866 105867","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

From Afghanistan to Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan to Turkmenistan work of individual artists have helped to maintain cultural traditions for millennia, whereas the interdependence of highly skilled urban artists of the Central Asian Khanates often reflect influences from the many foreign interactions that were an integral essence of the Silk Road. This installation will not include the art of the rug maker, who justifiably receives considerable exposure, but instead will highlight the art of the dyer and embroider.

Jim Denomie and Andrea Carlson demonstrate two different perspectives on their shared content of irony, story and politics.\r\nThe exhibition will include an expansion of Denomieâs ''Renegade'' series. Denomie plans to revisit these politically charged and humorous landscapes in order to show further developments in the renegadeâs ongoing saga. These paintings will be shown alongside an installation of portraiture from his painting-a-day series. By painting a daily portrait from his imagination, Denomie addresses the self-analytical qualities of painting others. These intense images complement Denomieâs Renegades by telling a different type of story that reads more like a personal diary.\r\nCarlsonâs ''Windigo'' and ''Aatisokaanag'' series will also be featured. In her ''Windigo'' series, Calson questions calcified views of authenticity and cultural purity through hybridized imagery. She is also interested in how stories are often ascribed to objects and how these objects become surrogates for cultural exchange. In the ''Aatisokaanag'' series, Carlson has painted her interpretations of the sacred stories. Each image in this series serves as a cross-section of a larger cycle of stories.","date":"Friday, April 06, 2007 - Sunday, May 27, 2007","objectId":"102276 102278 102279 102280 102282 102283 102330 102331 102332 102333 102334 102741 102742 102743 102745 102746 102747 102748 102749 102750 102794 102795 102796 102797 102798 102799 102800 102801 102802 102803 102806 102807 102808 102810 102811 102812 102813 102816 102817 102818 102819 102820 102821 102829 102830 102831 102833 102834 102835 102836 102837 102838 102839 102840 102841 102842 102843 102844 102845 102846 102847 102848 102849 102850 102851 102852 102853 102859 102860 102861 102862 102863 102864 102865 102866 102867 102868 102869 102870 102871 102872 102873 102874 102875 102876 102877 102878 102879 102880 102881 102882 102883 102884 102885 102886 102887 102888 102889 102890 102891 102892 102893 102894 102895 102896 102897 102898 102899 102900 102901 102902 102903 102904 102905 102906 102907 102908 102909 102910 102911 102912 102913 102914 102915 102916 102917 102918 102919 102920 102921 102922 102923 102924 102925 102926 102927 102928 102929","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

{"id":836,"title":"Don Harley Presents: Product Design Concepts","description":"A series of product designs dating from the 1950s through â80s are presented in this exhibition resulting from the tireless, creative energies of the entrepreneurial Don Harley, a St. Paul native. Over a lifetime career in industrial design, Harley initiated hundreds of designs to shape the products his clients were developing for the companies he represented, including those he owned between 1954 and 1986. âCreativity is practically synonymous with Harley,â wrote the associate editor of the Counselor, a national industry magazine in 1991. Harley has preserved an extensive archive from which these conceptions have been selected. The sketches resulting from his companiesâ drawing boards range from office products, toys, and advertising, to fire hydrants and snow blowers. As presentation drawings, they are remarkable for the innovative product designs being promoted, and the skilled draftsmanship utilized in glamorizing the individual pieces, all executed with color pencils â the media of the moment before computers took full rein of the design process. Through the years, Harleyâs clients at home and abroad included Honeywell, Toro, Playskool and Hallmark.

Containers provided a means for creative, spiritual, and intellectual expression while preserving the traditions of their ancestors.\r\nThis mini-exhibition explores how the various functions of these containers dictated their size, form, and designs, as well as how they represented cultural wealth and ways of life. Containers from different tribes that reveal the similarities, diversity, and beauty of these functional and important objects will be presented.

{"id":841,"title":"The Genius of Shibata Zeshin: Japanese Masterworks from the Catherine and Thomas Edson Collection","description":"This exhibition highlights the work of Shibata Zeshin (1807â91). Trained as a boy in the art of gold-flecked lacquerware, he gained a reputation as a master lacquer artist by reviving techniques long forgotten, and by advancing the field by integrating many new materials into his designs. He first studied painting to improve the decorations he applied to his lacquerware, but he soon became so adept the paintings themselves won high praise. Trained in the naturalistic manner of the Shijo School, Zeshin rejected the slippily executed and formulaic designs of his colleagues and fought to maintain the quality of traditional Japanese craftsmanship. His crowning achievement was to invent a technique that allowed him to paint with lacquer on paper and silk. This installation is the first to examine Zeshinâs work by looking at his dual role as a cultural preservationist and technical innovator.

{"id":845,"title":"Frank Lloyd Wright for Everyman: The Malcolm Willey House and the Lindholm Service Station","description":"This exhibition will explore two watershed designs that helped define the second half of Frank Lloyd Wrightâs architectural career. The major portion of the exhibition will be devoted to the Malcolm Willey House, built in Minneapolis in 1934. The Willey House was the product of Wrightâs radical rethinking of the single family home for the middle class, and served as a prototype for his later Usonian homes. As well, the exhibition will feature the Lindholm Service Station, built in Cloquet, Minnesota in 1958, where Wright combines commercial function and architectural daring. This design closely followed Wrightâs 1932 service station for Broadacre City, his visionary--but unbuilt--American town plan. The exhibition will include original drawings from private collections and from the Frank Lloyd Wright Archives, as well as objects from the Willey House and photographs of the houseâs recent award-winning restoration.","date":"Saturday, September 29, 2007 - Sunday, January 20, 2008","objectId":"103404 103405 103406 104211 104212 104213 104214 104215 104216 104217 104218 104232 104233 104234 104403 104404 104405 104406 104407 104408 104410","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

Eleventh century buildings have been through centuries of care, neglect damage and restoration. Griep uses her drawings, some over 30 feet long, to try to understand and express the underlying nature of the sites. She searches for an understanding of the correspondences and the differences that go deeper than the surface details and express visually the worldview and tradition of the builders. The act of drawing is meditative; it mimics the role of these buildings as a way of concentrating attention.","date":"Friday, June 15, 2007 - Sunday, August 12, 2007","objectId":"103431 103432 103433 103434 103435","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

{"id":854,"title":"Uzbek Embroidery in the Nomadic Tradition","description":"This is an exhibition of Central Asian embroidery made at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century (ca 1880-1930). This exhibition will consist of approximately 60 non-utilitarian (no clothing) embroidery made by peoples making the transition between nomadic and agrarian life styles. It will also include a few urban wall panels.The horse-breeding Lakai, agrarian Kungrat and settled peoples of Samarkand and Bukhara who created these embroideries all lived their lives on the exotic silk road that still excites our imagination. Their textiles reflect the diversity and rich aesthetic traditions of Central Asia as well as the identity and cultural values of their creators.

{"id":858,"title":"Veiled Communications: Head Coverings from South Asia","description":"For modesty's sake, women throughout much of the Indian subcontinent traditionally have covered their head and shoulders with a shawl or veil. In public, the feminine ideal was fully clad and quiet. But the veils themselves were another matter. They told stories.\r\nThrough pattern and color, material and workmanship, a veil spoke of geographic origin, tribal affiliation, economic standing, and marital status. It told the season and social occasion. It could provide talismanic protection. And sometimes, when fashioned for her own use by a woman of a certain skill and temperament, a veil turned community tradition into an expression of personal whimsy. Always a flag of identity, these pieces of cloth revealed as much as they concealed.\r\nRepresenting almost a century of collecting, \"Veiled Communications\" assembles two-dozen superb head coverings from India and Pakistan that broadly reflect the region's diverse textile traditions of dyeing, embroidering, printing, and weaving.","date":"Saturday, October 27, 2007 - Sunday, April 13, 2008","objectId":"103590 103591","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

Her large format, photo-realist paintings are saturated with theatrical lighting and bright colors to emphasize the ominous nature of the situation. Three artists come together for this exhibition to explore issues of military representation in popular culture; the relationship between patriotism and fear and the way war and conflict is brought into our homes. Justin Newhall presents large-format, color photographs of historical battle re-enactments. Megan Vossler creates delicate graphite renderings from public images of marching troops, soldiers and refugees. Camille Gage alters military photographs, reducing the images to their essential and most powerful elements.","date":"Friday, August 31, 2007 - Sunday, October 28, 2007","objectId":"104153 104154 104156 104164 104165 104167 104168 104170 104171 104173","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}
{"id":862,"title":"Hiddur Mitzvah: Aesthetics in Jewish Ritual Art","description":"Hiddur Mitzvah is a Hebrew phrase that means âadornment of the commandment.â It refers to the admonishment set forth in Jewish law to create the most beautiful ceremonial objects possible in order to enhance religious rituals. Hiddur Mitzvahâs roots were established when Moses sang, âThis is my God and I will glorify Himâ (Exodus 15:2). Such ornamentation of ritual objects is considered an example of Mitzvot, or good deeds. This exhibition explores the concept of Hiddur Mitzvah by featuring ceremonial objects and textiles from the Minneapolis Institute of Arts and private collections that demonstrate the highest quality in craftsmanship and materials.

{"id":873,"title":"Streamline Design: The Essence of Speed","description":"Inspired by the acquisition of the aerodynamic 1936-designed Tatra T87 automobile, the eighteenth consecutive modernist exhibition at Wells Fargo Center is devoted to streamline design. In the 1930s, the essence of time and speed were exemplified in a body of work that embraced industrial design, new synthetic materials, worship of the machine and the cult of the future. The advent of the teardrop form, the sexy, windswept, contour, speed lines and sleek, shiny surfaces are manifested in an array of imaginative concoctions that convey a residue of charm and innocence.\r\nThe exhibition is comprised of works drawn from the Instituteâs extensive Modernism collection in which superstar designers such as Norman Bel Geddes, Kem Weber, Henry Dreyfuss, Raymond Loewy â among many unheralded but equally talented designers â are represented. The streamline aesthetic remains one of the most enduring episodes of the 20th-century, characterized by panache and energy. Little wonder there is a widespread resurgence of interest in this fascinating chapter of design.","date":"Monday, October 09, 2006 - Friday, September 28, 2007","objectId":"6950 6954 7105 40257 40279 40604 60023 61365 62524 63487 67805 91029","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

{"id":879,"title":"River to Infinity--The Vanishing Points","description":"River to Infinity - The Vanishing Points is the summation of a series of reflective mirrored landscape installations that present the viewer with visually constructed cultural dualities. The work points to the convergence of manifest destiny, contemporary American environmental values, and the vanishing of the natural world by recognizing the demise of species, peoples, and, through metaphor, society. At the same time, River to Infinity celebrates the excesses and the opalescent beauty of western culture in a fantasia of recontextualization: the work exists as a place of inspiration and horror. At first, the opulence gratifies and distracts the viewer. As time passes, the viewer is reflected in the mirrored surfaces of the installation, triggering an awareness of personal complicity and entrapment in a web of causation. \r\nRiver to Infinity is an entirely reflective landscape containing a mirrored river. On the banks of the river, reflective floral and fauna of endangered and extinct species coexist with fantastic and ambiguous reflective animals borne of recombinant DNA technology. At both end points of the river, separated by its length, video projections of constantly changing American landscapes play on the walls of the space. As the videos are projected, they are reflected on the mirrored surfaces of the river and its sculptural life forms.

{"id":905,"title":"Friedlander: Photography","description":"Comprised of six early color portraits, nearly 500 black-and-white gelatin silver prints, and approximately 50 examples of Friedlanderâs books, special editions, and portfolios, Friedlander: Photography traces a prolific career that continues to thrive after half a century. Supplemented by a modest number of loans from the artist, the retrospective is largely drawn from the Museum of Modern Artâs extensive collection of Friedlanderâs work. There are groups of photographs, each narrowly tailored by date, theme, and style. Groups that present distilled versions of Friedlanderâs books are identified as such. Completing the exhibition are seven displaying Friedlanderâs portfolios and special editions. A fully illustrated catalogue accompanies the exhibition.","date":"Sunday, June 29, 2008 - Sunday, September 14, 2008","objectId":"105836 105837 105838 105839 105840 105841 105842 105843 105844 105845 105846 105847 105848 105849 105850 105851 105852 105853 105854 105855 105856 105857 105858 105859 105860 105861 105898 106157 106264 106265 106266 106267 106268 106269 106270 106271 106272 106273 106274 106275 106315","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

The Passion was the most highly venerated subject during the fifteenth and much of the sixteenth centuries, a phenomenon characterized by high-strung devotions and empathetic emotionalism. Popular Passion tracts encouraged such meditations by elaborating on Gospel events with wholly invented miseries, designed to intensify peopleâs empathy for Christâs suffering. As this exhibition shows, printmakers followed suit, adding new forms of torture, inventive coloring, and other wrenching devices to heighten the drama of Christâs sacrifice.","date":"Saturday, May 10, 2008 - Sunday, November 02, 2008","objectId":"7437 46765 46774 46775 46782 47054 47065 47071 47085 47100 47523 47526 47531 47602 47938 48014 49880 49911 49913 50625 54023 54219 54257 54300 55630 56157 56927 57356 60300 66987","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

{"id":983,"title":"Eero Saarinen: Shaping the Future","description":"This exhibition is part of a comprehensive project that explores the work of one of the most prolific, unorthodox, and controversial modern masters of 20th-century architecture and design. Finnish-born Saarinen (1910-1961) is best known for such modern icons as the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial (Gateway Arch) in St. Louis, Missouri (designed 1948, completed 1964), the Trans World Airlines Terminal at JFK Airport in New York City, and Dulles International Airport in Chantilly, Virginia (both completed 1962). Saarinenâs presence in the Midwest is very strong, with his creation of corporate campuses for General Motors (Technical Center, Warren, Michigan, completed 1956) and IBM (Rochester, Minnesota, completed 1959), as well as churches and campus projects including his collaboration with his famous architect father, Eliel, on Christ Church Lutheran in Minneapolis, Minnesota (1949). By examining the architectâs entire output of more than 50 built and proposed projects, Eero Saarinen: Shaping the Future will be the first opportunity to understand Saarinenâs collective work in the larger context of postwar modern architecture. It will also address his sculptural furniture, including the famous âWombâ chair Eero designed in 1948 for Knoll. The exhibition will be organized into two sections: âBuilding for Postwar America,â shown at the MIA will focus on building types, illustrating the wide range of Saarinenâs projects in the context of their cultural and political significance; and âThe Architect and his Milieu,â shown at the Walker will examine Saarinen and his many collaborators including designers Charles Eames, and Alexander Girard, and local architect Ralph Rapson.

{"id":986,"title":"Masterpiece Photographs from the Minneapolis Institute of Arts: The Curatorial Legacy of Carroll T. Hartwell","description":"The Minneapolis Institute of Arts has the Upper Midwestâs most significant permanent collection of fine photographs. Numbering about 10,000 photographs, it covers the entire history of the medium, from the mid-nineteenth century to the present day.\r\nThis exhibition features the fifty most salient and fully-realized photographs in the museumâs holdings. It begins with a 1845 salt print by the English inventor William Henry Fox Talbot and ends with a 2002 color portrait by Alec Soth, from his series âSleeping by the Mississippi.â In between, the genres of documentary photography, photo-journalism, and street photography are well represented in the show. Included are Dorothea Langeâs âMigrant Motherâ and Arthur Rothsteinâs âDust Storm,â both iconic images from the Great Depression. Among the most recognizable pictures are Edward Westonâs âPepper No. 30â (1930) and Ansel Adamsâs âMoonrise, Hernandezâ (1941). The names of other photographers represented reads like a whoâs who of photography: Berenice Abbott, Diane Arbus, Eugene Atget, Richard Avedon, Walker Evans, Robert Frank, Lee Friedlander, Lewis W. Hine, Man Ray, W. Eugene Smith, Alfred Stieglitz, and Paul Strand.\r\nThis is the first time that the Minneapolis Institute of Arts has presented such a highly-selected grouping of its most important photographs. The exhibition and its accompanying publication commemorate the significant collecting legacy of Carroll T. (Ted) Hartwell, the founding curator of the department, who died in 2007. It reveals Mr. Hartwellâs critical eye for singular historical pieces as well as his belief in the influence and vitality of accomplished living photographers.

{"id":1026,"title":"Swiss Graphic Design: Precision and Presence","description":"The year 2009 marks the 20th annual Modernism exhibition presented at Wells Fargo Center in downtown Minneapolis. To commemorate the anniversary, Wells Fargo Minnesota has donated a series of twenty Swiss posters â emblematic of the Swiss International Style dating from 1950 -1985 â to the Minneapolis Institute of Arts.\r\nA haven for artists fleeing two world wars, neutral Switzerland formulated a distinct advertising style with special emphasis on the poster format. Swiss artists had been exposed earlier to the move-ments and styles flourishing elsewhere in Europe, yet it was not until the late twenties that the Swiss poster exemplified a universally recognized signature style.\r\nThe active encouragement of poster design by the Swiss government at national and local levels and the institution of an annual competition to promote it were significant, as were such important journals as Graphis (founded in 1944) and Neue Grafik (New Graphic Design) founded in 1958. Replete with articles summarizing the major tenets of the Swiss Style, it was responsible for establishing Switzerlandâs reputation as the epicenter of modernist typography. Moreover, the schools of applied arts in Basel and Zurich became internationally important education centers for graphic design.\r\nSwiss designers developed a number of new typefaces in the 1950s, the most popular and celebrated being Helvetica,* a refined version of Akzidenz Grotesk, a 19th-century sans-serif typeface. Helveticaâs widespread use became integral to the clarity and easy legibility of the Swiss graphic style. In fact, sans-serif type was the most emblematic component of the International Typographic Style. In 1954, Adrian Foutiger designed Univers, a mathe-matically constructed and visually programmed font with twenty-one variations.\r\nAmong the younger Swiss designers who emerged in the 1950s through the â70s as important innovators were: Armin Hofmann (his 1965 book, âGraphic Design Manual,â was a key manifesto of elementary design principles), Tino Steinemann, Car","date":"Tuesday, January 27, 2009 - Sunday, July 12, 2009","objectId":"106871 106872 106873 106874 106875 106876 106877 106878 106879 106880 106881 106882 106883 106884 106885 106886","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

Every subsequent Czech photographer acknowledged Sudekâs pioneering work and contributed, in their own way, to the rich photographic legacy of their country. Among them were the modernists Frantisek Drtikol and Jaromir Funke, the surrealist Eva Fuka, and the contemporary figure-photographer Jan Saudek. These and other individuals working in what is now the Czech Republic created one of the strongest contributions to twentieth-century photography in all of Europe.

{"id":1063,"title":"Holiday Traditions 2009-2010","description":"Since 1951, the MIA has decorated its American and European period rooms each year to show winter holidays as they were celebrated in times past. Nine period rooms showcase a range of special occasions, from a feast in Tudor England to a 1770s Hanukkah celebration in Providence, Rhode Island. Examples of early Christmas trees and Nativity scenes are highlighted in the Bell Family Decorative Arts Court and the Mary C. and Walter C. Briggs Gallery. To further explore the holidays this year, a selection of seasonal childrenâs books from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries will be on view in the Bell Court. Tours of the period rooms are led by costumed docents and are offered several times per day. For information on holiday tours of the period rooms, please call 612-870-3131.\r\nAs well, the MIAâs Prairie-School style Purcell-Cutts House, designed in 1913 by William Gray Purcell and George Grant Elmslie for Purcell and his family, is decorated for the holidays to reflect the upper-middle-class, âprogressiveâ lifestyle of the Purcells around 1915. Throughout the holidays, visitors can enjoy lively tours by costumed docents emphasizing the gifts, toys, food and social traditions of each period. Tours of the Purcell-Cutts House, given on weekends from November 28 through January 3, can be reserved at 612 870-6323 or online.","date":"Friday, November 27, 2009 - Sunday, January 03, 2010","objectId":"33274 33275 33468 33475 33485 33486 33487 33488 33490 33495 33496 33497 33499 33500 33502 33503 33507 33512 33513 33516 33581 33637 60160 63536 63537 63538 83524 83529 83530 83532 83533 95817 95818 95827 95828 98638 101340 101341 101342 101343 101344 101345 101346 101347 101348 101349 101357 101462 105099 106869 108707 108711 108712 108713 108714 108715","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

{"id":1077,"title":"The Louvre and the Masterpiece","description":"The Louvre and the Masterpiece will explore how the definition of a âmasterpiece,â as well as taste and connoisseurship, have changed over time. The exhibition will feature sixty-two works of art drawn from all eight of the MusÃ©e du Louvreâs collection areas, spanning 4,000 years. Paintings, sculpture, decorative arts, and drawings will reflect three major themes: the changing historical and cultural definitions of a masterpiece; authenticity and connoisseurship; and the evolution of taste and scholarship.\r\nThe exhibition explores the changing historical definitions of a masterpiece through selections of objects from the ancient Near East through mid-nineteenth-century Europe and introduces the idea of connoisseurship as a means of identifying works from the past as masterpieces. It also examines masterpieces that were either rediscovered or reattributed based on the changing knowledge and perceptions of Louvre curators during the past two hundred years.\r\nAn in-depth examination of French sculptor Antoine-Louis Baryeâs bronze Lion and Serpent further elucidates the exhibition themes, such as the significance of technical mastery and the creative process, and the impact of the artistâs reputation.

Collectively, their influence is unparalleled.

{"id":1108,"title":"Rembrandt in America","description":"During the Gilded Age, Americans developed an appetite for paintings by 17th-century Dutch master Rembrandt van Rijn. His paintings are now found in public and private collections from coast to coast. This exhibition will bring together one of the most substantial groups of Rembrandt paintings assembled in America in a generation. While the main focus of the show will be on the artist and his remarkable development as a painter, attention will also be given to his influence on other artists, his status as an icon, and Americaâs relationship to his art. Taken as a whole, the Rembrandts in America have a distinctive character: the overwhelming majority are in portrait format whether they are portraits or not. The MIAâs own Lucretia, a single-figure half-length, is a prime example.\r\nThe paintings will be a placed in groups that attempt to illuminate specific issues, such as Rembrandtâs experimentation with different ways of handling paint, his interest in actual portraiture and in various types of fantasy portraiture, and the issue of defining the boundaries of his art. While this exhibition cannot be viewed as a full-scale retrospective, it will provide visitors the rare opportunity to observe Rembrandtâs evolution from brash young artist, to confident master, to resolute observer of timeless humanity. Rembrandt collecting has always been a challenging field. The works can be difficult and expensive to obtain, and questions of authenticity are ever present. American collectorsâand they are not alone in thisâhave often bought paintings thinking that they were getting Rembrandts only to find out later that they were the product of other hands. For this reason, a number of works formerly attributed to Rembrandt will be displayed, including one or two for which the pendulum of scholarly opinion has swung back and forth. We hope to use this opportunity to suggest answers to the all too obvious but usually evaded question: If Rembrandt is such a genius, why is it so difficult to tell which paintings are his?\r\nThe exhibit","date":"Sunday, October 30, 2011 - Sunday, September 16, 2012","objectId":"529 114647 114648 114658","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

{"id":1114,"title":"Embarrassment of Riches: Picturing Global Wealth, 2000-2010","description":"Embarrassment of Riches explores how contemporary media artists have depicted wealth over the last ten years and upends the usual attention given to images of poverty. Following a decade of unprecedented historical fluctuations of wealth on a global scale, this exhibition is not a celebration of affluence and consumerism but an examination of the societal effects of prosperity. \r\nPhotographers have long sought to document the effects of the economy, focusing their cameras almost exclusively on the plight of the poor and the socially disadvantaged. Most famous is Lewis Hineâs documentation of child laborers at the beginning of the 20th century and the Farm Security Administrationâs survey of the migrant and rural poor during the Great Depression.\r\n \r\nThe exhibition addresses prosperity through three major themesâCurrencies; Space; and Rituals and Style. Photographers Jacqueline Hassink (Dutch) and Alec Soth (American) document the private spaces of haute couture. Cindy Sherman (American) impersonates the patrons who support her work and the art world, and Alex Prager (American) stages the Hollywood poses of a generation influenced by cinema style. Artists Eve Sussman (American), Martin Parr (British), and Tina Barney (American) examine social rituals in Los Angeles, Europe, and the Middle East. Abelardo Morell (Cuban) reveals the speculative nature of value and the sheer quantity of goods that circulate within society. Luc Delahaye (French) investigates Davos and the behind-the-scenes financiers and politicians who fund commerce. Sze Tsung Leong (Chinese) and Robert Polidori (Canadian) document the transformation of China and other emerging countries.","date":"Thursday, September 16, 2010 - Sunday, May 29, 2011","objectId":"108445 109915 110737 110738 110739 110740 110741 110742 110743 110744 110776 110777 110797 110798 110799 110800 110802 110804 110805 110809 110810 110811 110813 110888","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

Bojagi are cloths wrapped around objects for protection and transport. Although these were made out of small scraps of material, woman would decorate them to create beautifully patch-worked wrappers. Suh uses this technique to protect memories and experiences. Her installations are comprised of multiple pieces, delicate packages containing small bits of intangible information in sheer cloth. Often the packages are silk-screened with images and text, offering clues to the interior.

{"id":1131,"title":"The Experimental Print: Stanley William Hayter and Artists of Atelier 17","description":"Hayterâs Atelier 17 was seminal for the adventurous printmaking of the mid-20th century. He encouraged artists to try their hand at printmaking, and the studio became a meeting place for the exchange of artistic ideas. Hayterâs stimulus was particularly widespread, for Atelier 17âs 60-year run in Paris (1927 to 1988) was interrupted by a ten-year exile in New York during the 1940s. Moreover, Atelier 17 became a prototype for the collaborative workshops that have played a central role in printmaking over the past several decades. Dennis Jon has selected this presentation of innovative prints by European and American artists who worked with Hayter. The roll includes familiar names, such as MirÃ³, Masson, Arp, Chagall, Lasansky, Nevelson, Nicholson, De Kooning, and Pollock. Others, such as AndrÃ© Racz and Leo Katz will be new to most of our visitors.","date":"Saturday, September 04, 2010 - Sunday, March 06, 2011","objectId":"195 6113 7253 7295 7312 7568 7691 7876 9549 42589 42738 43666 43667 43673 43989 44006 48061 48479 48713 54005 54139 54519 56874 56875 56876 56878 56879 56880 56881 56882 56884 56885 56886 56888 56889 56891 56892 56894 56895 56896 56897 57085 57086 57118 57119 57226 59323 59357 59404 59963 62491 63936 80177 81318 103543 107166 109138 110083 110084 110642 110643 110644","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

{"id":1134,"title":"Wide-Eyed: Panoramic Photographs","description":"The word âpanoramaâ was coined in the late eighteenth century by the Irish artist Robert Barker to describe his own elongated paintings. Shortly after the invention of photography, in 1839, its practitioners also embraced the format, first making multiple-part pictures and, later on, individual images created with a succession of panoramic cameras. Most panoramic photographs fall into two categories; either they mimic normal human vision, or they extend it. Panoramas that mimic our vision are those that present a wider (or taller) view of a scene in a straightforward mannerâone that an individual could take in on his or her own, by merely moving oneâs head. Panoramic photographs that extend our vision are those that show us something we cannot actually see on our own. They extend not so much our vision of the world, but our comprehension of it, by stopping time, showing multiple views of a subject, or other results that only a camera can achieve.\r\nThe exhibition will comprise about thirty-five photographs, books by Josef Sudek and Edward Ruscha, one installation piece by Ken Fandell, and a coffee can reproducing a landscape by Ansel Adams. Among the photographers represented are Berenice Abbott, Oscar Bailey, Frederick H. Evans, Christopher Faust, Gus Foster, Mark Klett, Stuart D. Klipper, O. G. Rejlander, Art Sinsabaugh, Todd Webb, and Jonathan Wells. The photographs will range in time from 1848 (a daguerreotype) to within the last few years (digital color prints).

Jennifer Davis, Erika Olson, Terrance Payne, and Joe Sinness create work that focuses on self-image and the desire to create order where nature would have it otherwise. \r\nDavisâs paintings pick up where her subjects trails of thought drop off. The pastel images create a surface veneer of innocence and charm that hints at darker truths beneath the surface. Olsonâs drawings and sculptures question the human impulse to clean up and arrange nature and their need to immortalize once-living objects. Payneâs oil pastels use narrative elements and line and color to capture awkward moments in lifeâs pursuits. Sinness uses colored pencil and sculpture is a personal examination of queer domesticity using fable, history and unconfined possibility as visual metaphor.","date":"Friday, October 22, 2010 - Sunday, January 02, 2011","objectId":"111044 111045 111046 111047 111048 111049 111050 111051 111052 111053 111054 111055 111056 111058 111059 111060 111061 111062 111063 111064 111065 111066 111067 111068 111069 111070 111071 111072 111073 111074 111075 111076 111077 111078 111079 111080 111081","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}
{"id":1148,"title":"Bad to the Bone: Prints from the Grip of Death","description":"Death has a lot on his calendar. Of course, there is the work of ministering to and menacing his endless stream of more or less willing clients. But, he also has parties to attend, concerts to perform, and places to go. He is an athlete, adept at riding horses, driving chariots, and maneuvering other contraptions that most of us know little about. His musical skills include stringed instruments, percussion, and brass. It comes as no surprise that he is also a gifted dancer. Death also has a practical side, as demonstrated by his mastery of agricultural implements and time pieces. He is unimpeachably democratic in his associations. In fact, it is difficult to think of anyone he would avoid. Many have claimed the title of âThe Great Equalizer,â but ever-busy Death retains the crown.\r\nSo compelling is Death that he has been a subject of fascination to artists since the Middle Ages. This exhibition, a complement to âThe Mourners: Tomb Sculptures from the Court of Burgundyâ (January 23âApril 17, 2011), features the flip-side of the human act of mourning as seen by artists ranging from Renaissance master Hans Holbein to Mexican surrealist Rufino Tomayo. Some artists take delight in the dark humor of the netherworld, some shock us with its fearsome aggression, and others find poignancy in its comfort. Some remind us that Death is an unexpected visitor for whom we must prepare; while, others see Death approaching quickly, attracted by our actions.\r\nDespite his busy calendar, Death beckons you. Great artists urge you to accept his invitationâin your imagination for the presentâfor eventually Death is sure to find you.","date":"Wednesday, December 22, 2010 - Sunday, June 19, 2011","objectId":"8136 43603 44282 48327 48328 48329 48330 48567 48834 48851 48888 48897 49137 49636 50024 50110 50117 50515 52503 53878 54029 55852 56121 96064 101677 110548 111120 111184","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

{"id":1160,"title":"Facing the Lens: Portraits of Photographers","description":"Photographers, naturally, have a unique relationship with the camera, given it is their tool of choice. They are accustomed to being behind it, shooting with it, and seeing the results of their efforts. Many photographers are also comfortable situating themselves in front of their lenses, making self portraiture either an aspect of their work or its mainstay. On the other hand, some are notoriously camera shy, allowing few photographic images of themselves--Henri Cartier-Bresson being among the most notable.\r\nPortraiture is one of the oldest, enduring, and constant genres of image making, in all media. In the early decades of photography, humans made up the vast majority of subjects placed before the camera, because people believed whole-heartedly in the verisimilitude of the medium. Since photographs were taken âfrom natureâ and did not involve the hand of the artist, they were thought to perfectly depict the physical--and sometimes even spiritual--characteristics of the sitter. Today, we know this to not necessarily be the case, and as photographers continue to confront the camera face on, the lens happily offers up photographic half truths and âlies.â\r\nThis exhibition features about 75 pieces, drawn largely from the MIAâs permanent collection, dating from the 1850s to within the last decade. There are both self-portraits and images by other makers. The eye of the photographer is examined as a metaphor for seeing and the act of photographing and cameras are suggested as an extension of the photographerâs eye. In this vein, images are included of Brassai, Bill Brandt, Man Ray, and Robert Mapplethorpe.\r\nThe idea that a single, solitary photographic image of an individual can fully represent its subject is, of course, spurious. Multiple images, therefore, can fill in the blanks and give a more rounded impression of the sitter, as demonstrated by many acute photographers.

In some examples, the overt moralistic message is tempered with erotic overtones. \r\nThe works in this exhibition were made by Italian, German, French, Dutch and Flemish artists at a time when printmaking became a common art form.

{"id":1172,"title":"William Blake: Illustrations of The Book of Job","description":"The British visionary poet, painter, illustrator, and engraver William Blake (1757-1827) was one of the leading figures of the Romantic era. Illustrations of The Book of Job, first published in London in 1825, ranks among Blake's best-known and most enduring achievements. This masterwork of the engraver's art comprises 21 line engravings and an engraved title page; each plate is accompanied by text that Blake selected from Job and other books of the Bible.\r\nThe Book of Job, one of the books of the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament), recounts the trials and eventual spiritual awakening of Job, a virtuous and wealthy citizen of Uz. The biblical text was written as a didactic poem framed by a prose prologue and epilogue. Intended as a challenge to the belief that misfortunes are punishment for sin, The Book of Job was for Blake the apotheosis of lyric expression.\r\nTaken as a whole, Blake's engravings are a metaphysical commentary in the form of a symbolic narrative. By Blake's own account, the engravings are not to be read literally, but are rather to be spiritually discerned as conceptions of the artist's personal reading of the Bible. To Blake, Job's spiritual journey paralleled his own creative struggles and spiritual awareness. Completed when the artist was nearly 70 years of age, Illustrations of the Book of Job is the last of Blake's experiments in combining text and image.","date":"Saturday, December 23, 2006 - Sunday, June 17, 2007","objectId":"46414 46416 46417 46418 46419 46421 46422 46425 46426 46428 46429 46430 46431 46432 46435 46452 46453 46454 46455 46456 46457 46458","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}
{"id":1173,"title":"L'Ancien RÃ©gime: Life at the French Court","description":"The glittering society of Versailles was a popular subject in prints in 17th and 18th-century France. For the estimated 1,000 courtiers who kept rooms at the chateau, a dizzying schedule of amusements was offered each seasonâfÃªtes, masquerade balls, outdoor theater performances and concerts, fireworks displaysâwith no expense spared. Arranging these entertainments and parties was important business, overseen by an official bureaucratic department of the kingâs householdâcalled the Menus Plaisirs du Roiâwhich employed a small army of artists, architects, and craftsmen to execute the elaborate undertakings. \r\nThe prints in this show, drawn from the permanent collection although many never before exhibited in the museum, capture the splendor of the Ancien RÃ©gimeâor âOld Regimeâ as post-Revolutionary France termed the former system of aristocratic rule. Many of the printmakers, Charles Nicolas Cochin II, Jean-Michel Moreau, Jean Le Pautre, were commissioned by the kings to commemorate the most important of these celebrations and fÃªtes, with a desire to propagate, both at home and abroad, the grandeur of their reigns. Ironically, these widely disseminated images of the frivolity and decadence of courtly life may also have fostered mounting tensions against the royal regime, helping to turn the oppressive system on its head at the end of the 18th century.","date":"Saturday, June 30, 2007 - Sunday, December 09, 2007","objectId":"7196 7891 7912 7940 8831 8874 42642 43359 48141 48143 76097 76099 76101 76102 76104 76105 76422 76424 76853 77205 77363 77364 77457 77487 77488","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

{"id":1177,"title":"Sir Francis Seymour Haden: Physician and Printmaker","description":"During his lifetime, Sir Francis Seymour Haden (1818-1910) was better known as a surgeon than as an artist. It was considered proper for a 19th century English gentleman to learn how to draw and to collect art, but more as an avocation than as a profession. Haden pursued his medical training in London and Paris and eventually came to specialize in obstetrics. His private practice was successful enough to allow him to acquire a significant collection of old master prints, a well-appointed London home, and a country manor house, and to travel frequently throughout England and the rest of Europe. It was during these holidays that Haden turned to etching and to his favorite subject, the landscape and the eternal beauty of nature. \r\nWhile a medical student at the Sorbonne in Paris, Haden took night classes in anatomical drawing at the Ãcole des Beaux-Arts \"to train his powers of observation\" and to improve his surgical skills. In 1844, on a trip though Italy, he etched his first copper plate. Haden returned to the medium in 1857, and, because he was convinced that etching was an art form equal to painting, he founded the Royal society of Painter-Etchers. He also authored several art books including The Etched Work of Rembrandt (1879) and was knighted for his artistic accomplishments by Queen Victoria in 1894.\r\nDespite the vital role he played in the graphic arts, Haden never considered himself a professional artist. He was an amateur in the best sense of the work, and left behind an important legacy of etched works and writings. The 31 Haden prints in this exhibition were selected from more than 250 of his etchings, drypoints, and mezzotints held in the Department of Prints and Drawings at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts.

She was particularly fascinated by the transformation of caterpillars into butterflies and moths, and her images reveal their successive stages of development from egg, to caterpillar and pupa, and finally to mature adult. The book that resulted from her two year study, Metamorphosis insectorum Surinamensium (Transformation of Suriname insects), included ninety studies of insects, most drawn life-size.

{"id":1179,"title":"On the Same Page: Artist's Books New to the Collection","description":"Artistâs books emerged as an art form in the late nineteenth century, and have since become repositories for unbounded artistic imagination. The chance to interpret a favorite text with their own vision is, for many artists, irresistible. The artistâs books exhibited hereâspanning more than a centuryâdisplay a unique commingling of words and picture on the same page, from Pierre Bonnardâs exquisitely daring ParallÃ¨lement to Donald Baechlerâs quizzical Double Whammy. \r\nThe Minneapolis Institute of Arts is committed to continually strengthening its collection of artistâs books, now numbering more than 600 works housed in the Department of Prints and Drawings. This exhibition presents a selection of recent and important additions to the permanent collection. As these books demonstrate, Greek poetry can provoke an artistâs imagination as readily as a modern-day fairy tale. The artist and author may be friendsâlike Sonia Delaunay and Jacques Damaseâor the artist may take on the dual role of author and illustrator, as Hans Arp and Mark Beard do here.\r\nExciting, experimental, unexpectedâthe artistâs book format signifies, above all, collaboration between publisher and printer, image and text, high art and craft. The possibilities for expression ensure that all will persist in meeting on the same page for a long time to come.","date":"Saturday, December 02, 2006 - Sunday, May 20, 2007","objectId":"45517 47027 62737 62767 62829 66008 81034 83899 95442 95725","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

{"id":1214,"title":"A Vision of Paris: Etchings of Charles Meryon","description":"The etchings of Charles Meryon (1821-1879) reveal a vision of Paris before the changes put into effect during the rule of Napoleon III's Second Empire. Meryon's prints capture the essence of the medieval sections of town that were being torn down to accommodate the wide boulevards and new parks and squares of the Emperor's master plan. Yet, Meryon's etchings are not simply exact renditions of vanishing structures, but a personal vision of a city he loved. This vision was darkened by a severe mental illness which eventually took the artist's life just as his etchings were receiving serious attention and favorable reviews. Meryon's legacy of beautifully executed etchings continues to fascinate viewers, and he is considered on of the most gifted printmakers of all time.","date":"Friday, April 05, 2002 - Sunday, August 11, 2002","objectId":"8228 9186 39479 47222 50549 50561 50565 50567 50568 50569 50570 50571 50573 50582 50585 50596 50600 50612 50634 55606 55611 55612","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

She controls the physics of paint, but also lets go of that control to open up to the paintâs own properties. The irresistible tensions on the surfaces of her large-scale paintings keep viewers looking. Wall-Romana structures her paintings using an elaborate atmospheric perspective balanced with non-illusionistic color. A sharp student of art history, she conflates the still-life delicacies of the Dutch Golden Age with Mannerist attitudes towards scale, Hudson River School atmospherics, and yolky Abstract Expressionist smears. Formally, she pushes the physical properties of paint to their limit, with her use of thin, translucent colors to create delicate surfaces, and chalky impasto for ripe forms and textures.","date":"Friday, January 21, 2011 - Sunday, April 03, 2011","objectId":"111409 111411 111412 111413 111415 111416","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

This is the first time they have been exhibited outside of the gallery. The ravishing pendants, âDiana and Acteonâ and âDiana and Callistoâ have been aptly described as ranking among the most poetic creations of the Italian Renaissance and are indisputably the two most significant works by Titian outside of Italy and Spain. Originally painted for King Philip II (d. 1598) of Spain, they eventually made their way to England and into the Bridgewater/Sutherland collection at the end of the 18th century. \r\nIn addition to the Bridgewater Titians and Titianâs equally famous âVenus Rising From the Seaâ (formerly a Bridgewater picture) the exhibition includes eight other paintings by Lorenzo Lotto (1), Jacopo Tintoretto (1), Jacopo Bassano (1), Paris Bordon (2), Giovanni Cariani (1), and Paolo Veronese (2). A number of these are very large in scale, and all are recognized masterpieces of Venetian Renaissance painting. \r\nAs a complement to the paintings, the exhibition features a selection of approximately 12 stunning Venetian drawings by the following masters: Titian, Domenico Campagnola, Battista Franco, Lorenzo Lotto, Palma Giovane, Palma Vecchio, Pordenone, Jacopo Tintoretto, and Paolo Veronese. \r\nExit Titian and the Golden Age of Venetian Painting through Venice on Paper, an MIA organized companion exhibition exploring the city through the graphic arts, bringing together five centuries of original prints, drawings, books, and photographs, all made in or about this enchanting âfloatingâ city.","date":"Saturday, October 16, 2010 - Sunday, August 14, 2011","objectId":"111557","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

From Francisco Goyaâs renowned Disasters of War etchings to Otto Dixâs infamous Der Krieg (War) portfolio to Daniel Heymanâs powerful portraits of tortured Iraqi War prisoners, the selection shines a bright light on the ravages of war and violence as seen through the eyes and minds of artists. \r\nAlso featured are important graphic works by HonorÃ© Daumier, KÃ¤the Kollwitz, Max Pechstein, Max Beckmann, George Bellows, George Grosz, Pablo Picasso, Jacob Lawrence, David Rathman, Ken Campbell, Stephen Dupont, as well as a major sculptural installation by British contemporary artists Dinos and Jake Chapman.\r\nThis exhibition was organized in conjunction with the museum-sponsored program MIA Inside/Out: Battle of Everyouth, a special one-night event presented as part of the Northern Spark Festival, a citywide celebration of experimental contemporary art in public places. This free program begins at sundown on Saturday, June 4, 2011, on the shared campus of the MIA and Minneapolis College of Art and Design.

Taking that collection as a departure point, this exhibition brings attention to the museumâs modest but notable holdings of design from the post-World War II era to the present.

This exhibition focuses on these developments through over thirty examples of furniture, industrial design, jewelry, and other consumer objects, including notable recent acquisitions. Works by Americans Charles and Ray Eames, Harry Bertoia, Frank Gehry, and Michael Graves, as well as Europeans Eero Aarnio, Piero Fornasetti, and Jens Quistgaard, are among the designers included.

{"id":1290,"title":"A Connoisseurâs Cabinet: Drawings from the Joseph F. McCrindle Collection","description":"Joseph F. McCrindle (1923â2008) was a tireless and gifted art collector, with a particular fondness for drawings. He began collecting seriously in the 1960s and never stopped, forming one of the greatest private collections of drawings in America in the 20th century. Traveling frequently to London and Italy in search of great drawings, the collection grew to a staggering 2,500 works before his death. It was not only remarkable for its size, but also its breadth and quality, guided by an exceptionally discerning eye.\r\nMr. McCrindleâs passion for drawings was matched by a generous spirit. Upon his death, his collection was divided up among some 30 American institutions, with the MIA acquiring a total of 98 works from his collection. Celebrating this extraordinary gift to the museum, this exhibition features selections from this rich, and very personal collection. And Mr. McCrindleâs generous legacy continues to enrich our institution. Four of the studies from his gift came to the museum in a fragile state, and they were recently conserved with a generous award from the Joseph F. McCrindle Foundation.","date":"Saturday, June 25, 2011 - Sunday, January 15, 2012","objectId":"104090 104092 107181 107183 107185 107186 107189 107191 107193 107199 107200 107201 107202 107204 107205 107207 107209 107212 107213 107224 107226 107229 107248 107257 107258 107259 107279 107280 107281 107283 107284 107348 108284 108285 108286 108287 109275 109276 109277 109281 109283","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

{"id":1292,"title":"The Sports Show","description":"Photography, moving images, and new media outlets have transformed sporting events into spectacles of mass participation, pop culture, and political drama. Early, innovative photographers and filmmakers were fundamental to this transformation, creating powerful images that put millions of people in the center of the historic, athletic-action. The Sports Show spotlights the artistry and cultural significance of this shift.\r\nEarly 20th-century photographers first captured leisure sports. Jacques-Henri Lartigueâs photographs of his familyâs adventures driving racecars and flying planes exemplified these private and personal endeavors. Media imagery, however, quickly moved sports into the public arena. By the 1960s, televised events radically altered the nature of sports, playersâ standings, and fansâ participation. Charismatic professional athletesâJoe Namath, Muhammad Ali and othersâbecame international pop icons, and television audiences expanded exponentially. Roger Welchâs The O.J. Simpson Project, reveals Simpsonâs early attempts to shape his popular image as a non-athlete, and is seen in the exhibition for the first time in the U.S. since its 1977 premier. \r\nNow, in the 21st century, body-thumping music, roaming cameras, and multi-screen global broadcasts of sporting events create larger-than-life spectacles that attract the critical attention of contemporary artists. Capturing the power of these events, a centerpiece of the exhibition is Paul Pfeifferâs The Saints, an immersive sound-and-video installation based on the 1966 World Cup final between Germany and Great Britain, which examines nationalism and crowd dynamics in sports. It was shown previously at Hamburger Bahn of in Berlin, Germany, and the Guggenheim Museum, Bilbao, Spain. The installation at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts is its U.S. premier.\r\nThe Sports Show features approximately 175 astonishing works arranged around themes such as Leisure; Circulation; Politics; Icons; Race; and Spectacle.

{"id":1298,"title":"New Pictures 5: Jason Fulford","description":"A few years ago, a friend gave artist Jason Fulford a manila envelope, found at a flea market. The envelope contained over 80 photographs of different mushroom types, each composed and annotated with the care of someone who just had to be a mushroom collector. These anonymous photographs inspired Fulford to create his own collection of photographs, publications, sculptures, and performances, all under the umbrella of his fictional Soon Institute. Similar to the lifecycle of mushrooms, the project goes underground and periodically sprouts up in various artistic forms (including The Mushroom Collector, a book he published in 2010), in unexpected locations, such as New York, California, and Amsterdam. The âMushroom Collectorâ is now rumored to be arriving this October at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts as part of âNew Pictures 5,â and we are looking forward to seeing what form it will take.\r\nJohn Cage, the avant-garde musician, thinker, and, of course, mushroom collector, noted in his book For the Birds (1981), âItâs useless to pretend to know mushrooms. They escape your erudition. [The more you know them] the less sure you feel about identifying them.â Fulfordâs photographs draws inspiration from Cageâs pleasure, wonder, and openness in the pursuit of visual knowledge. The pictures appear to be unremarkable shots of commonplace objects, people, and places. Yet a closer look reveals humorous and subtle oddities: a crane lifting two ladders; a natural branch form casting an artificial multicolor shadow; a happy threesome running toward a cave as though part of a travel advertisement. Instead of a singular, heroic photograph, Fulfordâs images reveal themselves through repetition, sequences, relationships between form and shadow, abstraction and reality. \r\nFulford is the co-founder of the publishing house J&L Books in Atlanta / New York, and the author of several titles, such as Sunbird (2000), Crushed (2003), and Raising Frogs for $$$ (2006). This will be his first museum exhibition.","date":"Friday, October 21, 2011 - Sunday, April 08, 2012","objectId":"112427 112430 112431 112432 112433 112434 112435 112436 112437 112438 112439 112440 112441 112442 112443 112444 112445 112446 112447 112448 112449 112450 112451 112452 112453 112454 112455 112456 112457 112458 112459 112460 112461 112462 112463 112570 112571 112572 112573 112574 112575 112576 112577 112578 112579 112580 112581 112582 112583 112584 112585 112586 112587 112588 112589 112590 112591 112592 112593 112594 112595 112649 112650 112651 112652 112653 112654 112655 112656 112657 112658 112659 112660 112661 112662 112729 112730 112731 112732 112733 112734 112735 112736 112737 112738 112739 112740 112741 112742 112743 112744 112745 112746 112747 112748","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}
{"id":1299,"title":"Edo Pop: The Graphic Impact of Japanese Prints","description":"The Minneapolis Institute of Arts is home to some 3,000 Japanese woodblock prints. These works, collectively known as ukiyo-e, or âpictures of the floating world,â were produced during Japanâs Edo period (1600-1868). Reflecting the interests and activities of the newly emerging class of moneyed commoners, ukiyo-e prints first featured the reigning beauties of the pleasure quarters and the dashing actors of the Kabuki Theater. Later, artists expanded their repertoires to include landscapes, floral studies, legendary heroes, and even ghoulish themes. Although similar exhibitions have been organized chronologically with prints by individual artists and artistic lineages grouped together, this exhibition is arranged thematically: Women of the Floating World; The Yoshiwara; Actors and the Kabuki Theater; Great Escapes (Travel Prints); Heroes and Warriors; Visual Witticisms (Mitate-e); Classical Inspirations. \r\nEdo Pop: The Graphic Impact of Japanese Prints showcases 188 of the Minneapolis Institute of Artsâ best prints by the genreâs greatest artists including Harunobu, Kiyonaga, Utamaro, Shunsho, Sharaku, Toyokuni, Hokusai, and Hiroshige. Collected and donated by some of the museumâs most generous donors, including Richard P. Gale and Louis W. Hill Jr., the prints comprising this exhibition are renowned for their superb preservation, breathtaking designs and colors, and astonishingly refined printing techniques. \r\nWhile the impact of Japanese woodblock prints on the French Impressionists has been well documented through exhibitions and publications, the enduring influence of this art form, even into the 21st century, has received little attention. This exhibition will demonstrate how these lively, graphic images and their urbane subjects continue to inspire contemporary artists, both in Japan and around the world.

{"id":1311,"title":"Bonjour Japon: A Parisian Love Affair with Japanese Art","description":"Like a tidal wave hitting the shore, the impact of Japanese art on European artists of the late nineteenth century was startling and profound. Japanese woodblock prints, screens, scrolls, and decorative objects opened new aesthetic possibilities, particularly for artists working in Paris at the turn of the century. Ukiyo-e woodcuts and a wide variety of Japanese artifacts were on display at World Fairs, in commercial galleries, and in Parisian private collections. Virtually every artist working in Paris at the end of the century felt the influence of Japanese art. Western artists incorporated asymmetrical compositions, calligraphic lines, birdâs-eye views, flat areas of color, bold patterns, and outlines into their work. Inspired by the Japanese love of subjects from everyday life and nature, European artists explored similar themes, while Japanese screens, scrolls, and fans led to the appearance of similar formats in Parisian galleries and exhibitions. \r\nBonjour Japon: A Parisian Love Affair with Japanese Art will capitalize on two major strengths within the MIAâs permanent collectionâturn-of-the-century French prints and Japanese art. The works in this exhibition will come from the MIAâs permanent collection of prints and drawings and be organized into four thematic groupings mixing a broad scope of artists including Pierre Bonnard, Mary Cassatt, Edgar Degas, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and Edouard Vuillard. The categories will echo the organization of the adjacent and complementary Edo Pop: The Graphic Impact of Japanese Prints. This synergy will allow visitors to continue their journey through the museum and enable them to easily continue their exploration of the concept of ukiyo-e.","date":"Saturday, October 01, 2011 - Sunday, January 22, 2012","objectId":"7264 7290 7291 7301 7373 7592 7862 7865 7887 8217 8734 8878 9655 22429 22462 32482 40312 45658 45668 46994 50530 54128 54330 55018 55185 55202 55366 55701 55981 56476 59877 61200 61829 63080 65955 65969 66556 99242 104343 108710 112727 112728 112762","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

{"id":1324,"title":"Craft and the Hand: From Visible to Integral","description":"The world of the handmade object is changing. Makers, curators, collectors, and scholars are discussing the expansion of the contemporary craft field into conceptual areas. Crucial to this discussion is the current role of traditional values, such as function and perfection, as expressed through craft objects. Can these concepts be examined on a sliding scale of emphasis when applied to craft-based media?\r\nCraft and the Hand explores these various perspectives. The exhibition takes as a point of reference the role of the hand in contemporary craft, a fundamental concept that still has relevance in this changing field. Through objects in the MIAâs permanent collection and various loans, Craft and the Hand explores, through thematic groupings, how very different philosophies are carried out by craft-based artists in their work. These range from perfection of form through skill, to using excellent handcraft to achieve a conceptual emphasis, to conscious elimination of the mark of the hand. Featured artists include Bob Stocksdale, Warren MacKenzie, Ken Price, Susan Warner, Frank E. Cummings III, and Amy Sabrina.","date":"Saturday, November 12, 2011 - Sunday, July 15, 2012","objectId":"113075 113257 113260 113262 113263 113264 113265 113266 113267 113268","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

{"id":1333,"title":"Painted to Printed: The Book In Transition","description":"Prior to 1450, all European books were made by hand. Scribes copied texts letter by letter. To illustrate or decorate the pages, artists used pens and brushes to apply ink or paint, and sometimes further embellished them with burnished gold. In the last half of the 15th century, however, books changed dramatically. By the year 1500, printing presses had taken over much of the work.\r\nJohannes Gutenbergâs invention of movable typeâperfected by 1450âimmediately revolutionized the replication of texts, but the transformation of illustration and decoration took longer. For decades, many books were hybrids with printed texts and hand-made decoration. Printed imagesâwith or without coloringâslowly began to appear in books. \r\nBefore the printing revolution, the most skilled artists illustrated only books meant for the richest and most powerful patrons. Once printed images could be issued in great numbers, however, great artists began to design illustrations for books catering to the middle class. Albrecht DÃ¼rer so fully understood the potential of printed books of pictures that he even assumed the role of publisher, taking control of the entire process, from design, to production, to distribution. His illustrations for The Apocalypse (1498) proved black-and-white images could be so compelling that one would not want to spoil them with coloring.\r\nBy looking at single leaves from books dismembered long ago, one can reconstruct the history of book illustration. Here you can see comparisons of painted and printed works, as well as objects that combine both processes. In many cases, the printed works were made to simulate their painted predecessors, but sometimes influence ran in the opposite direction. Witness the ingenuity printers brought to mass production. Some attempted to print text and image from a single surface or to employ modular elements that could be re-used and re-combined. Others tried to use finely engraved copper printing plates, although woodcuts ultimately proved more practical.

{"id":1458,"title":"Layered Abstraction: Quilting and Contemporary Fiber Art","description":"Contemporary fiber artists working over the last forty years have mined American folk quilts for techniques and patterns commonly seen in these ubiquitous domestic objects. Drawing inspiration from the quiltâs geometric structure, contrasting, often bold color and fabric combinations, and decorative layers of stitches, the artists featured in this exhibition explore personal expression through references to this traditional textile art. Combining multiple techniques with a conscious, sophisticated approach to composition, many of these works can be seen in the context of the so-called âsurface designâ movement active since the 1970s. \r\n âLayered Abstractionâ features a variety of contemporary fiber art from the MIAâs collection. In addition to works by Sheila Hicks, Jack Lenor Larsen, and Jan Myers, it will showcase a recent MIA acquisition: Mary Lee Bendolphâs striking quilt, Strings, a contemporary example of the Geeâs Bend, Alabama quilting style. Strings well illustrates how the Geeâs Bend quilters have interpreted traditional designs in highly-individualized fashions, producing functional quilts that are now prized as abstract artworks. The exhibition will also feature quilt-inspired garments from the Goldstein Museum of Design and, as part of the MIAâs ReMix initiative, an exploration of layered abstraction in relief sculpture by Minnesota abstract artist Charles Biederman.","date":"Saturday, March 10, 2012 - Sunday, August 26, 2012","objectId":"114126 114127","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

{"id":1498,"title":"Seven Billion: Gregory Fitz","description":"This exhibition will be the debut of Gregory Fitzâs ambitious 3-part installation. Comprised of day-glo gestural landscapes, paintings made after Ansel Adams photographs, and cinder block table sculptures, âSeven Billionâ is a response to the aesthetic projects of modern art and architecture. Itâs no accident that Fitzâs work is made from economical materials such as insulation foam and chip board, or that he works so quickly. By doing so he wants to leave his decision making process visible and make a counter-point to the legacy of modern painters and sculptors. This leaves his work wide open for questions about the sacred value given art, the environmental concerns of art making, and the emphasis placed on craft and presentation. Fitzâs work has been part of group exhibitions at Form+Content, the Soap Factory and Weisman Art Museum.","date":"Friday, April 20, 2012 - Sunday, July 01, 2012","objectId":"114416 114417 114418 114419 114420 114421 114422 114423 114424 114425","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

{"id":1503,"title":"More Real? Art in the Age of Truthiness","description":"The past century has been a period of unprecedented technological change and global social upheaval, causing a dramatic shift in our collective perception and experience of reality. Once agreed-upon beliefs, or âtruths,â have been cast into doubt. As viewers of The Colbert Report know, we are living in an age of âtruthiness,â where things we wish to be true are preferred to things we know are true. \r\nIn this exhibition, contemporary artists from around the world use unexpected and diverse means to explore this modern conundrum. Their work can be divided into three general categories (often overlapping).\r\n1âDeception and Play: From Trompe lâOeil to the Authentic Fake\r\nThese artworks appear to be paintings or sculptures, but play with deception, navigating the borders of illusion and reality, between the authentic and the fake.\r\n2âReshaping the Real: Film, Memory, and the Virtual\r\nThis art uses film, video, and photographyâmedia once thought to faithfully reproduce realityâto challenge assumptions about the physical and the virtual.\r\n3âThe Status of Fact: Unreliable Narrators, Parafiction, and Truthiness\r\nSuch artists create fictional identities, stories, and works that are presented as fact. \r\nThe artworks in More Real? Art in the Age of Truthiness grapple with fascinating questions about the world today: How do we define what is real in a world where a multitude of media can radically reshape the original experience being depicted? What is the role of technology in such artistic expressions? How do we navigate between truthiness and deception in everyday life? When can fiction be truthful? \r\nIn a time when the relationship between fact and fiction has never been murkier, the artists in âMore Real?â explore a shifting sense of what is real and what is not, and the consequences of not understanding the difference. \r\nThe exhibition More Real? Art in the Age of Truthiness, along with an accompanying 304-page catalogue and an interpretive website, provides a broad historical and cultural context for the questions that","date":"Sunday, July 08, 2012 - Sunday, June 09, 2013","objectId":"114579 114580 114581 114585 114586 114587 114588 114589 114590 114591 114592 114593 114594 114595 114596 114603 114604 114605 114606 114607 114608 114609 114610 114611 114622 114623 114624 114625 114626 114627 114628 114629 114630 114631 114632 114659 115754 115839 115840 115841 115842 115843 115844 115845 115864 116059 116062 116081 116085 116086 116087","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

Concurrently with \"Rembrandt in America,\" the MIA will present an exhibition of the master's etchings. From quick sketches to elaborate baroque masterpieces, Rembrandt produced an astonishingly imaginative and diverse body of work. He studied beggars in the street, loved ones in his home, and unforgettably his own likeness--sometimes growling at us, sometimes costumed as a dandy, sometimes displaying full awareness of his own limitations. He recorded the world around him, from humble animals to majestic trees to dilapidated farmhouses. He reimagined the stories of the Bible, each time endowing the scene with drama or tender human emotion. This exhibition shows the mind of a genius at work.","date":"Sunday, June 24, 2012 - Sunday, September 16, 2012","objectId":"7728 8230 8249 8750 8833 8834 8835 9201 9202 42098 55076 55108 55110 55111 55120 55121 55335 55348 55365 55369 55379 55734 55735 55736 55737 55738 55739 55744 57582 57583 57585 57586 57690 57691 107160 107161 108008 108013 114896","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

His fastidious drawings, sculptures, and books are a collaboration with excerpts from classic literature but he has replaced the words with thousands of individual \"Es\", inserted gaps, and bent the lines to make the original text unreadable. He is exacting in how the resulting forms follow the precise word count of the original text, yet, like a concrete poem, turned them into abstract and architectural compositions of the narrative that spread the edge of the page. The silver-point mark making he uses in the large-scale graphite and ink drawings will slowly tarnish, turn to black, and no longer be visible on the hand-made paper. Also on display in âDeeper Wonders Than the Wavesâ are scattered floor sculptures are bent paper drawings that barely stand up as 3-dimensional forms.

{"id":1547,"title":"A Handsome Cupboard of Plate: Early American Silver in the Cahn Collection","description":"The cupboard of early American domestic and presentation silver assembled by Paul and Elissa Cahn over some thirty years is unified by strong design, fine craftsmanship, and awareness on the part of the collectors for both the course of American history and the history of the craft in the colonies.\r\nâA Handsome Cupboard of Plateâ begins in Boston, with a c. 1690 caudle cup marked by the first native-born American silversmithâJeremiah Dummer (1645-1718)âwhich has a history of ownership in the Tufts family of Massachusettsâproceeds to New York, with a robust tankard and a distinctive large fluted and gadrooned caster reflecting the Dutch heritage of that region marked by Bartholomew Schaats (1683-1758), and progresses to Philadelphia, where generations of the Quaker Richardson family supplied goods of the âbest sort, but plainâ to their clientele, including Lydia and Oswald Peel, who acquired an octagonal covered sugar dish and tea caddies ca. 1736.\r\nSilver of the post-Revolutionary War era in the Cahn cupboard documents transitions to a new aesthetic that exploited available technology for rolling sheet metal and a neoclassical ornamental vocabulary. The shop of patriot Paul Revere Jr. notably utilized both new manufacturing techniques and the new ornament. These changes are apparent in the laurel-leaf wreath enclosing the dedicatory inscription on the Danielson Family commemorative tankard (c. 1783), and in the seamed, fluted, and swag-and-tassel engraved Adams-Quincy teapot with stand (c. 1790). In New York and Philadelphia, the shops of Myer Myers and Joseph Lownes (1758-1820) utilized the sleek, smooth, âflattedâ (rolled) sheet silver in hooped tankards and canns, respectively.\r\nThe end of the second presidential term of George Washington in 1797 closes out the Cahn cupboard of plate. Myer Myers died in 1795; Joseph Richardson II became second assayer at the U. S. Mint (by Washingtonâs appointment), and Paul Revere Jr. left the artisan silversmithâs shop to preside over industrial production of bells, cannon, ","date":"Saturday, December 01, 2012 - Monday, May 25, 2015","objectId":"115557 115558 115559 115560 115561 115562 115563 115564 115565 115566 115567 115568 115569 115570 115571 115573 115574 115576 115579 115580 115581 115583 115584 115585 115586 115587 115588 115589 115590 115592 115605 115606 115607 115608 115609 115610 115611 115612 115613 115614 115615 115616 115617 115618 115619 115620 115621 115622 115623 115624 115625 115626 115627","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}
{"id":1548,"title":"Picturing Poverty: Artistic Views of the Poor in the Baroque Era","description":"During the 17th century, artists in Europe began looking to everyday life for their subjects, with special attention to the poor.\r\nThe plight of the impoverished came to the fore during the Thirty Years War (1618â48), which reduced broad swaths of Europe to subsistence living or starvation. People were also familiar with Gospel teachings that exalted the poor as inheritors of the kingdom of heaven. Jesus himself was born in a humble stable and had simple shepherds as his first visitors. Artist after artist depicted the Holy Familyâs flight into Egypt, riding on a donkey and cooking over a campfire. A strong note of compassion informed the work of Stefano della Bella and Rembrandt, whose portrayals of wretched humanity in this exhibition often took on a remarkably personal character.\r\nMany artists were able to find a sort of ragged dignity in the lower levels of society. They showed the poor in attitudes of industrious acceptance or stoicism, where a battered hat became a crown of virtue, a sign of resolute endurance of a miserable life. Such fortitude found adherents especially in France with the Le Nain brothers, whose sympathies are evident in the realism of their painting now in the Louvre, where poor farmers are portrayed, in all their deprivation and sad acceptance of poverty.\r\nIn other cases, an insistent attention to the decorative value of tattered and patched clothesâtorn caps and shoes, wrinkles, sagging cheeksâsuggests a colder curiosity, a simple pleasure in the representation of the picturesque, and a willingness to caricature misery.\r\nAs this exhibition demonstrates, artists interpreted poverty in many ways. For Adriaen van Ostade, it sometimes became the equivalent (both in cause and consequence) of spiritual misery. For William Hogarth, it would lead to the social denunciation described in his famous satire Gin Lane (1751). Whether the emphasis was on debauchery or the delineation of a frayed hem, the work of Baroque-era artists found the poor to be rich subject matter indeed.","date":"Saturday, December 15, 2012 - Sunday, June 02, 2013","objectId":"729 2264 8834 9663 12069 19354 33434 39462 43408 48572 49058 49061 49072 49082 49101 49105 49107 49108 51473 51736 54889 54890 54893 54894 54898 55098 55099 55100 55101 55102 55103 55105 55759 55803 57585 57586 105102 105124 105130 105136 105189 105788 108009 109723 115683 115684","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}
{"id":1549,"title":"Visions from the Forests: The Art of Liberia and Sierra Leone","description":"Visions from the Forests: The Art of Liberia and Sierra Leone is the collection brought together between 1965 and 1987 by the late William Siegmann. Siegmann visited Liberia for the first time in 1965 to teach history. In the ensuing decades he lived on and off in Liberia for fifteen years, pursued a graduate degree in African art history at Indiana University, and was a major force behind the development of two museums in Liberia. During this time he developed a life-long passion â and formidable eye â for African art resulting in an extensive personal collection. In 1987 he became the Curator of African Art at the Brooklyn Museum of Art and continued research on his collection. Before he passed away in November 2011, Siegmann â a native of Minneapolis who had maintained strong connections with his hometown â started donating portions of his collection to various museums including the Minneapolis Institute of Arts.\r\nCovering a period from the fifteenth to the late twentieth centuries, with many examples from the nineteenth century, Visions from the Forests: The Art of Liberia and Sierra Leone will showcase approximately seventy-five pieces, created by artists from over a dozen different ethnic groups. Some of the highlights include: a Mano face mask with feathers and shoulder cap; a large horizontal mask from the Loma; a Vai helmet mask by an identified yet unnamed master carver from around 1900; a rare wooden female figure by a Sherbro artist; a brass tortoise cast by the famous Dan caster Ldamie of Gaple; a unique sixteenth century Sapi stone sculpture representing a seated couple; ceremonial horn pendants adorned with silver in which inscriptions in Arabic and Vai have been written; a late eighteenth century side-blown ivory horn from the Krim; a Temne chiefly hat in silver modeled after a fez; and a tie dyed wrapper designed by contemporary artist Christina Tombe.","date":"Wednesday, April 09, 2014 - Thursday, December 31, 2015","objectId":"113292 113293 113297 113301 113306 113308 113408 113410 113412 113413 113415 113444 113445 113446 113448 113449 113458 113459 113466 113469 113471 113474 113476 113477 113478 113479 113483 113486 113487 113495 113496 113497 115714 115716 115723 115724 115725 115726 115727 115728 115729 115730 115731 115732 115733 115734 115736 115737 115738 115739 115740 115741 115742 115743 115744 115745 115746 115748 116331 119200 119201 119203 119258 119259 119260 119261 119262 119265 119266 119965 119966 119967 119968 119969 119970 119971 119972","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}
{"id":1550,"title":"Supper with Shakespeare: The Evolution of English Banqueting","description":"In collaboration with world-renowned English culinary historian Ivan Day, the Minneapolis Institute of Arts will present the exhibition, Supper with Shakespeare: The Evolution of English Banqueting, December 13, 2012 â March 31, 2013. The term âbanquetâ in the context of sixteenth and seventeenth century England meant a visually striking collection of after dinner sweet foods, preserves, and confections. In Shakespeareâs time (he died in 1616), such displays of culinary wonder were among the most magnificent in the history of British dining. Banquets were intended to impress and delight diners while the servants cleared the remains of the main feast, so they were often held in outdoor âbanqueting housesâ or in an intimate chamber such as the MIAâs Tudor Room. \r\nIn 1923, the Minneapolis Institute of Arts installed the Tudor Room as the museum's first period room, calling it \"the very embodiment of the spirit of the seventeenth century.\" Furnished with a rich assortment of tables, chairs, and case furniture that evoke the furnishings and lifestyle of Tudor England, the roomâs oak paneling dates to about 1600. Once part of a private chamber used for eating, sitting, and entertaining guests, the room came to the MIA with a history of use in a manor in Suffolk, England. \r\nFor Supper with Shakespeare, the Tudor Room will be laid out with a full banquet of period culinary delights hand-crafted by Ivan Day. The exhibition will continue in the adjacent Briggs Court, featuring dining related objects of silver, ceramic, and glass from the MIAâs collection, as well as an assortment of loan objects such as period cookbooks, food moulds, and kitchen utensils. The whole will enchant art lovers and foodies alike! \r\nPlanned programs include a âSupper with Shakespeareâ public lecture by guest curator Ivan Day on Thursday, December 13, 2012 at 11:00 am, sponsored by the Friends of the MIA; a private Tudor-inspired feast curated by Ivan Day, date TBD, complete with a special Tudor inspired ale locally brewed for the occasion; and","date":"Thursday, December 13, 2012 - Sunday, March 31, 2013","objectId":"115758 115759 115760 115761 115762 115763 115764 115765","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

From romanticized visions of agrarian life, to sobering depictions of beleaguered manual laborers and miners, to scenes of worksites, factories, and industrial landscapes, these images reveal strikingly diverse interpretations of what it means to work. The subject is especially prevalent among graphic artists and photographers, who have exploited the power of reproduction to disseminate their ideas.\r\nSelected entirely from the MIAâs permanent collection, the exhibition showcases more than fifty original prints, drawings, and photographs by prominent American and international artists and photographers active from the mid-nineteenth century to the present.

The outcome of this endeavor is not only an exhibition, but more importantly: an unvarnished series of interpretations that deal with the psychological phenomenon of selected memory and perception.\r\nBrewer will invite visitors to fill out a simple description form, a request to isolate one piece within the entire collection that has a personal resonance, and then put it into words. Patrons will fill out the description form, which will be provided at the entrance of each gallery.

{"id":1595,"title":"The Progressive Pencil: George Grant Elmslie's Prairie School Designs","description":"This exhibition commemorates the 100-year anniversary of the MIAâs crown jewel of Prairie School architecture, the Purcell-Cutts House, through a celebration of the design work of George Grant Elmslie (1869-1952). \r\nHaving worked for Louis Sullivan (1856-1924) for nearly twenty years, Elmslie became well-versed in organic design principles, carrying them over in the exceptional work of the Minneapolis firms of Purcell, Feick and Elmslie (1910-1913) and Purcell and Elmslie (1913-1921). His contributions to the integrated decorative schemes developed by the firms often included a combination of elements such as terra cotta, stained glass, stenciling, furniture, murals, and sawed wood, to create a harmonic whole greater than the sum of its parts. \r\nElmslieâs design drawing for the firm, rarely shown and minimally published, are delicate and beautiful studies, though they were meant to communicate to his partners and to the craftsmen who would execute these elements. The majority of these drawings are housed in the William Gray Purcell Papers at the Northwest Architectural Archives at the University of Minnesota. The exhibition will focus on the drawings as art objects, and as documents of the collaborative process of producing organic architecture. âThe Progressive Pencilâ would feature drawings for the Purcell-Cutts House and other notable Purcell and Elmslie projects such as the Merchants Bank of Winona, Minnesota (1911-13), along with historic photos and selected objects. Recent MIA acquisitions by Elmslie will also be featured, including the one-of-a-kind dining room suite for Mrs. Hanna (1915) with its wealth of detail. It will include approximately 15-20 of George Grant Elmslieâs elegant design drawings, alongside photos and related objects from the MIA and local collections.

{"id":1597,"title":"Battles in the Bedroom: Courtship and Marriage in Renaissance Italy","description":"During the 15th century, the bedroom was the most private and symbolic room in patrician homes. It was the locus of conception, birth, sickness, and death. \r\nLeon Battista Alberti (1404â1472), the famous architect and theorist of the Renaissance, in his book âOn the Familyâ (1432), describes how the newlywed husband gave his bride a tour of the house, finally entering the bedroom and locking the door. But his next move did not involve the rustling of fabric and the exposure of flesh. Instead, Albertiâs groom shows his new bride all the valuablesâsilverware, tapestries, clothing, and gems, as well as the splendid furniture where all these things would be secured. This passage makes clear how important the bedroom was at that timeâa space of family privacy and splendor.\r\nIn the most luxurious palaces, tapestries embellished the bedroom walls and helped to control temperature. A small altar for devotion was always present, often an image of the Virgin Mary with her child, propitious for childbearing. The rooms had no closets, and cupboards or armoires had not come into use; instead, chests were the means of storage. Such chestsâcassoni in Italianâwere richly decorated or painted with fables or episodes from the history. They were a fundamental item of home decoration and considered the most symbolic piece of furniture connected with marriage. Great attention was therefore paid to the subjects represented upon them, allusive to the husbandâs qualities, to the wifeâs chastity and obedience, and to the familyâs glory and wealth. Scenes of battleâreminders of hard-won power or triumphant moral virtueâwere favored, and one assumes that they were also entertaining conversation pieces.\r\nClothing, wedding gifts, family documents, and other treasures were locked up in the cassoni. Smaller elegant boxes contained jewelry, sewing kits, or other personal items. The bedâthe focal point of the room, and a very monument to lineage and fertilityâwas a complex machine, often placed on a raised platform that in some cases was also de","date":"Saturday, June 15, 2013 - Sunday, December 01, 2013","objectId":"109 111 1581 1582 1632 1681 7434 7470 14147 16992 16993 44010 44264 50635 119019","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

They can change their colors and patterns instantly, whether for communicating or active camouflage, as their chromatophores (pigment-containing and light-reflecting parts of cells) are expanded or contracted.\r\nDuluth artist Ryuta Nakajima has been studying the color-changing physiology and behavior of cephalopods in Japan. Using waterproof images of artworks from the MIAâs collection, he has photographed cuttlefish responding to and attempting to replicate the colors and patterns of European paintings, Japanese prints, and Islamic decorations. Nakajima has also created plastic molds of small cuttlefish, which he will mass-produce and paint in various patterns that mimic and stylize the cephalopod color-changing properties. Nakajima likens them to collectible Japanese Kubrick dolls.","date":"Thursday, July 18, 2013 - Sunday, September 29, 2013","objectId":"116490 116491 116492 116493 116494 116495 116496 116497 116498 116499 116500","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

{"id":1618,"title":"Shells: Magic and Science","description":"Shells are among the first items a child collects, instinctively, while walking on a beach. Shells are common, abundant and, at the same time, can be precious and extremely desirable. Their sound, when drawn to the ears, is the evocative, infinite sound of the waves.\r\nFrom the islands of the Pacific to African villages, from prehistoric shacks to the most sophisticated courts of Baroque Europe, the shellsâ translucent texture and their complex and fantastic forms can be recognized in everyday objects, in decorative patterns, in figurative symbols and in an incredible variety of art works.\r\nShells assume a primary position in the naturalistic studies of the modern era, along with the discovery of new lands, and the improvement of optical instruments. Their forms attest not only to the perfection and magnificence of creation, but also visually make manifest mathematical logarithms; they also bring to life, and help to solve, the religious drama of the evolutionary problem.\r\nCollecting shells can also be an expensive mania, as the first Mannerist Wunderkammern testify. There, nautilus and conches were mounted in precious metals, adorned with gems, âportrayedâ by painters in still lifes, and displayed in magnificent cabinetsâa pride of place in keeping with the importance of shells as an important field of naturalistic studies. \r\nMinneapolis and its surrounding area possess various treasures contained in the Minneapolis Institute of Arts and public libraries, including the Wangensteen Historical Library and the James Ford Bell Libraryâwhich, together, represent an immense patrimony of prints and precious antique books on natural history. \r\nThe exhibition encompasses the passion for shells from the Wunderkammer to the post-Linnaean era. A small section is devoted to the still nowadays never-extinguished fever of shell-collecting.","date":"Saturday, November 23, 2013 - Sunday, June 08, 2014","objectId":"22087 64021 64023 64031 71708 71711 71712 72147 73832 73845 73846 73888 73925 73940 73944 73946 74240 74257 74268 74287 74310 74583 74597 74600 75075 75084 75522 75523 75524 75525 75527 75538 75542 75543 75770 75787 75788 75866 75873 75876 76331 98954 109578 109579 111675 113369 116543 116544 118828 118832 118833 118834 118835 118836 118838 118840 118841 118842 118843 118844 118845 118846 118847 118848 118849","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

{"id":1630,"title":"How to make a world: Jaron Childs","description":"Childs will present a new series of hyper-realistic & finely details paintings, based on his own photographs that are a rejoinder to contemporary attitudes about beauty in painting. He has done this by carefully choosing images that both test the limits of what is an acceptable level of sentimentality for critical art, and offer visual pleasures that also contain sensations of alienation and loss. With a relatively small number of works, \"How to Make a World\" is meant to engage the various and contradicting claims made on painting regarding beauty, artistic merit, and its relevance as a medium. \r\nThe driving principle of Jonathan Bruce Williams MAEP exhibition will be to display the science and technology of vision. He creates fascinating sculptural installations that re-present digital and analog images and \"utilize photography as a technical and philosophical strategy.\" Most recently, he has been interested in ocular phenomena such as the persistence of vision, linear perspective and the stereoscopic illusion. For example, images will flicker, flash and appear stereoscopically with the aid of new and vintage machinery. Compositional elements, such as the symbolism of Americana and the history of photography, create formal affinities between the beacon of a lighthouse and a movie projector, or a picket fence and a zoetrope.","date":"Thursday, January 16, 2014 - Sunday, March 30, 2014","objectId":"119106 119107 119108 119109 119110 119111 119112 119113 119114 119115 119116","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}
{"id":1631,"title":"Finland: Designed Environments","description":"This exhibition looks at the explosion of creativity in Finnish design from the last fifteen years. Nearly every aspect of life in Finland incorporates thoughtful design thinking, and sensitivity to form and material. The name Designed Environments reflects the many aspects touched by design in Finland today, from home interiors, to the body, to city streets, to food.\r\nFinland: Designed Environments presents a selection of the most elegant, artistic, and thought-provoking objects and projects by Finnish designers, craftspeople, and architects. These objects share an inherent practicality, but are thoughtfully designed for an elevation of the userâs experience. Strong undercurrents in the exhibition include: the use of natural and local materials; respect for and closeness to nature, with an ecological emphasis; a high level of quality in all aspects; and a sense of wonder. Finland: Designed Environments is the first significant museum-organized exhibition outside Finland since the 1990s to examine the breadth of current Finnish design.\r\nThe exhibition Finland: Designed Environments will encompass furnishings, fashion, and craft, as well as architecture and urbanism. It will also address emerging and noteworthy areas of sensory design, graphic design, and systems design, as well as the intersection of design and food, all actively being addressed by Finlandâs design community.

{"id":1632,"title":"New Pictures 9: Rinko Kawauchi","description":"Rinko Kawauchiâs first museum exhibition in the United States shows why sheâs one of the most important and popular female photographers working in Japan today. Kawauchiâs unique installation of photographs at the MIA capture ordinary, fleeting moments of light and daily life, the photographs evoking everything from wonderment to the grotesque. A picture of a child breastfeeding. Ants carrying a grain of sugar. A tiny chrysalis on a blade of grass. She views the world with a playful, thought-provoking, and critically detached curiosity.\r\nKawauchi is also well known for her photography books, which present an evocative sequence of images unfolding on every spread. She has produced 15 photo books since 2001, including Light and Shadow (2012) and Illuminance, Ametsuchi, Seeing Shadow (2012). Now living and working in Tokyo, Kawauchi has exhibited around the world, including a recent solo exhibition at the prestigious Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Photography in 2012.","date":"Thursday, February 20, 2014 - Sunday, August 10, 2014","objectId":"119249 119250 119252 119253 119254 119255 119257 119271 119272 119273 119274 119275 119276 119277 119278 119279 119280 119281 119285 119286 119287 119288 119289 119290 119292 119293 119294 119295 119296 119297 119298 119299 119300 119301 119302 119303 119304 119305 119306 119307","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

{"id":1645,"title":"Matisse: Masterworks from the Baltimore Museum of Art","description":"Henri Matisse (French, 1969-1954) was one of the most influential artists of the 20th century, whose stylistic innovations fundamentally altered the course of modern art. In a career spanning six decades, his achievements in painting, sculpture, drawing, graphic arts, book illustration and paper cutouts earned the acclaim of collectors, critics and several generations of younger artists.\r\nMatisse initially trained as a lawyer before developing an interest in art. He moved to Paris to study painting in 1891. He followed the traditional academic path first at the AcadÃ©mie Julian and then at the Ãcole des Beaux Arts, but he also discovered a dynamic and experimental contemporary Parisian art scene. He began to experiment with a diversity of styles to create his own pictorial language. In 1905, Matisse exhibited at the Salon dâAutomne with AndrÃ© Derain, and their shockingly bold experiments with using color to structure their paintings brought them the derisive nickname âLes Fauvesâ (Wild Beasts). Across a succession of stylistic periods, Matisse aimed to discover the âessential character of thingsâ through art that expressed balance and serenity, as he explained in his Notes of a Painter (1908).\r\nThis sweeping exhibition features fifty paintings and sculptures and thirty works on paper spanning six decades of Henri Matisseâs prolific career. Drawn entirely from The Baltimore Museum of Artâs permanent collection, one of the most comprehensive collections of Matisseâs work in the world, this exhibition provides a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for a regional community to share in the beauty of such a magnificent body of work.\r\nIn addition to Matisse: Masterworks from The Baltimore Museum of Art are four exhibitions of outstanding works from the collection of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, all of them created or inspired by Matisse.\r\nChasing Matisse: American Moderns Under the Influence, Gallery 361\r\nMore Matisse, Please: Drawings and Prints, Gallery 369\r\nMore Matisse, Please: Book Illustration, Gallery 359\r\nMore ","date":"Sunday, February 23, 2014 - Sunday, May 18, 2014","objectId":"2810 10625 10634","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

{"id":1654,"title":"The Art of Murder","description":"Artists have long been drawn to the complicated murk of murder, from the biblical and quranic stories of Cain and Abel (the first murderer and first victim), to the horrific deaths of Jesus and early Christian martyrs, to gut-wrenching accounts of modern-day homicide.\r\nMurder is inevitably traumatic, a tragic narrative unfolding from the crime to its consequences. It is this story, whether arising from persecution, criminal intent, or a depraved sense of passion, that artists find so intriguing.\r\n Today, with murder constantly in the newsâif it bleeds, it leadsâand saturating our entertainment, from video games to mystery novels, we may be desensitized to its frightening reality. And yet our fascination with the ultimate crime endures, suggesting a primal need to grapple with its brutal truth. Artists, too, feel compelled to explore this meaning, as seen in the works here.\r\nThis exhibition was drawn from the MIAâs permanent collection of graphic Art and photography, and was complemented by key loans from private collectors.","date":"Saturday, July 19, 2014 - Sunday, April 19, 2015","objectId":"7207 7224 7227 7423 7424 7500 7519 7615 7889 9189 12945 32715 33400 33403 42912 43467 43505 43877 44006 46065 46067 46754 47994 48584 48862 49911 49919 52484 53634 53749 54998 55172 55301 55640 55644 57812 63564 65446 66987 105873 119696 119909","type":"exhibition","rotation":true}

By building up then surgically peeling back the layers of his paintings and sculptures, he is looking for a glimpse into past experiences. Unfinished wood frames, sheets of plastic, and raw building materials, expertly and quickly composed, have a strong visual language but they also show Holberg's interest in concepts of absence, transparency and recovery. These paintings and a new site-specific installation mark a dramatic change from his earlier work, especially his evolving interest in how artâs relationship to architecture is an opportunity to understand how fragmentary perceptions are the grist for memory and behavior.","date":"Friday, July 18, 2014 - Sunday, September 28, 2014","objectId":"119987 119988 119989 119990 119991 119992 119993","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

At the end of the period known as the âTwilight of the Mediciâ (exhibition title, Detroit 1974), this iconographically unusual ensemble refers back to Michelangeloâs cycle in the New Scristy of San Lorenzo, and to several other painted and sculpted masterworks of the Baroque period. Moreover, it demonstrates that Florentine bronze sculpture did not end with Giovanni Battista Foggini, Massimiliano Soldani Benzi, and Antonio Montauti, but Pietro Cipriani this cycle â together with the copies after the Antique recently acquired by the J.

{"id":1673,"title":"Repetition, Simulation, Repetition","description":"Mathew Zefeldtâs brightly colored acrylic paintings of 16-bit graphics and textures are appropriated directly from vintage video games he played as a teenager, classics such as DOOM, Super Mario Brothers, and Castle Wolfenstein. The themes of life and death, both real and virtual, are repeated throughout his work, as seen in his use of traditional memento mori, such as funerary reliefs and vanitas paintings. It may appear that the bricks and heroâs face in âWhen Youâre Dead, Youâre Deadâ are cut, then pasted, but each detail is meticulously handpainted. Gallery walls covered floor to ceiling with sheets of 16-bit brick vinyl wallpaper will complement the paintings.","date":"Thursday, October 16, 2014 - Sunday, December 28, 2014","objectId":"120338 120339 120340 120341 120342 120343 120344 120345 120346 120347 120348 120350 120351 120352","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

Itâs the whole story of American art, thoroughly and engagingly told in just a slice of a much larger collectionâa credit to Kuninâs discerning eye and his irrepressible love of the chase after great art.","date":"Thursday, January 01, 2015 - Sunday, December 06, 2015","objectId":"38344 56564 56578 56600 56603 56617 98658 98661 98687 98688 98689 98691 98693 99497 99499 99500 99503 99622 99623 102947 103635 106554 106558 106928 108020 108022 108024 108025 108026 108027 108028 111497 111498 111500 111502 111503 111504 111506 113721 119609 120479 120481 120483 120488 120489 120491 120492 120493 120496 120497 120500 120502 120503 120504 120506 120507 120510 120511 120515 120519 120521 120522 120532 120533 120535 120537 120538 120540 120547 120551 120555 120557 120558 120559 120560 120563 120565 120566 120568 120570 120571 120575 120578 120579 120580 120582 120584 120586 120587 120588 120589 120597 120675 120679 121589 121590 121591 121592 121593 121595 121596 121597 121598 121599 121600 121601 121602 121604 121605 121607 121608 121610 121611 121612 121614 121616 121617 121618 121619 121620 121621 121622 121625 121626 121628 121629 121630 121631 121632 121633 121634 121635 121636 121637 121638 121639 121640 121641 121642 121644 121645 121646 121648 121649 121650 121651 121652 121654 121657 121659 121660 121661 121662 121663 121664 121665 121666 121667 121668 121669 121670 121671 121672 121673 121674 121675 121676 121677 121678 121680 121681 121682 121683 121684 121686 121688 121689 121690 121692 121694 121695 121696 121697 121698 121699 121700 121701 121702 121703 121704 121705 121706 121707 121708 121709 121710 121711 121712 121714 121716 121718 121719 121720 121721 121722 121723 121725 121726 121727 121728 121729 121730 121731 121732 121733 121734 121735 121736 121737 121738 121740 121741 121742 121743 121744 121745 121748 121749 121750 121751 121752 121753 121755 121756 121757 121758 121759 121760 121761 121762 121763 121764 121765 121766 121767 121768 121769 121770 121771 121772 121773 121774 121775 121776 121777 121778 121780 121781 121782 121783 121784 121785 121786 121787 121788 121790 121791 121793 121794 121795 121796 121797 121798 121799 121800 121801 121802 121803 121804 121805 121806 121807 121808 121809 121810 121811 121812 121813 121814 121815 121816 121817 121818 121819 121820 121821 121822 121823 121824 121825 121826 121827 121828 121829 121830 121831 121834 121835 121836 121837 121838 121839 121841 121842 121843 121845 121846 121847 121848 121849 121850 121851 121852 121853 121854 121855 121856 121857 121858 121859 121860 121861 121862 121863 121866 121867 121868 121869 121870 121871 121872 121873 121874 121875 121876 121877 121878 121879 121880 121881 121883 121884 121885 121886 121887 121888 121889 121890 121891 121892 121894 121895 121896 121897 121898 121899 121900 121901 121902 121903 121904 121905 121906 121907 121908 121909 121910 121911 121912 121913 121914 121915 121916 121917 121918 121919 121920 121921 121923 121924 121925 121926 121927 121928 121929 121930 121931 121932 121933 121934 121935 121936 121937 121938 121939 121940 121941 121942 121943 121944 121945 121946 121947 121948 121949 121950 121951 121952 121953 121955 121956 121957 121958 121959 121960 121961 121962 121963 121964 121965 121966 121967 121968 121969 121970 121971 121972 121973 121974 121975 121976 121977 121978 121979 121980 121981 121982 121984 121985 121986 121987 121988 121989 121990 121991 121992 121993 121994 121995 121997 121998 121999 122001 122002 122003 122004 122005 122006 122007 122008 122009 122010 122011 122012 122013 122014 122015 122016 122017 122018 123900 123973 123974 123975 123976 123977 123978 123979 124224 124256 124296 124297 124298 124299 124300 124525","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

{"id":1750,"title":"Inventory: Carolyn Swiszcz","description":"Carolyn Swiszczâs paintings and linoleum prints of unpopulated streets put a humorous and sometimes eerie complexion on dozens of familiar St. Paul landmarks. The five new short videos in âInventory,â which include actors, puppets and diegetic voices, are rendered in her irresistible style. A church and grocery store are just a few of the stages in Super Bowl Sunday, Pizza, and Shrine, each of which are based on poignantly personal vignettes from her Massachusetts hometown. The gallery will include sculptures from the videos that are particularly strong narrative devices and have a presence Swiszcz describes as âquietly devout.â âInventoryâ is the first installment of an ongoing project that will develop over the next few years. Swiszcz has been featured in recent group and one-person exhibitions at venues including the Minneapolis Institute of Art and Highpoint Center for Printmaking.","date":"Thursday, January 15, 2015 - Sunday, March 29, 2015","objectId":"120771 120772 120773 120774 120775 120776 120777","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}
{"id":1751,"title":"Inverse Echo: Jonathan Kaiser","description":"Jonathan Kaiserâs âInverse Echoâ is an engaging sonic experience, a sculptural sound installation featuring a quartet of custom-made vinyl records on continuous repeat. Kaiser is interested in the tension between circular and linear conceptions of time, using looped records to explore the interconnection between past, present, and future. By varying the playback speed of the different records, he creates a perpetually shifting four-channel composition, evolving even as it repeats. The sculptural and spatial elements of the installation address related themes of symmetry and repetition. Kaiser is an internationally recognized musician and his one-person exhibition, âBlind Arcade,â was recently presented at the Rochester Art Center.","date":"Thursday, January 15, 2015 - Sunday, March 29, 2015","objectId":"120779 120780 120781 120782 120783 120784 120785","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

{"id":1790,"title":"Tokaido Road: Gus Foster and Ando Hiroshige","description":"In 1832 Ando Hiroshige traveled the Tokaido, the roadway linking the historic capital of Kyoto with Shogunâs court in Edo. Based on sketches made along the way, Hiroshige later created one of the worldâs most celebrated and artistically influential series of woodblock prints. Nearly 160 years later, Gus Foster, an American panoramic landscape photographer, was determined to retrace Hiroshigeâs footsteps. His 360Â° photographs, taken while walking the entire 306 mile route, strikingly document Japanâs metamorphosis in the twentieth century. This exhibition paired each artistsâ conception of the fifty-three âstationsâ of the Tokaido, revealing not only radical changes in Japanâs topography, but also the vast differences between artistsâ inspiration, materials and creative interpretation.","date":"Saturday, August 22, 1998 - Sunday, October 04, 1998","objectId":"84088 84089 84090 84091 84092 84093 84094 84095 84096 84097 84098 84099 84100 84101 84102 84103 84104 84105 84106 84107 84134 84135 84136 84137 84138 84139 84140 84141 84142 84143 84144 84145 84146 84147 84148 84160 84161 84162 84163 84164 84165 84166 84167 84168 84169 84170 84171 84172 84173 84174 84175 84176 84177 84178 84179","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

{"id":1802,"title":"100+: A Photograph For Every Year of the MIA","description":"100+ celebrates the MIAâs Birthday Year with photographs from every year since the museumâs founding. With more than 12,000 images in the collection of the Department of Photography and New Media, the hard part was choosing one from each year! Some years were easier than others: 1916 offered just five works, while 1993 had 333.\r\nThe resulting exhibition reveals something wonderfully idiosyncratic: freed from the narrative traditions of photographic history, yet tied to the collecting habits and tastes of MIA curators.\r\nBut what about the +? The MIAâs interest in photography reaches back to 1903, before this buildingâor the MIA itselfâeven existed. Known then as the Minneapolis Society of Fine Art, this precursor held its first photography exhibition in the Minneapolis Public Library at 1834 Emerson Avenue North. It would be another 70 years before the MIA established its Department of Photography, in 1972.\r\nIn the spirit of â100+â, you are invited to share your favorite photos from any year of your life. Simply post your photo to Twitter or Instagram using #tbtMIA. Your photos will appear on a screen outside the Harrison Photography Gallery throughout the run of the exhibition.","date":"Thursday, March 19, 2015 - Sunday, May 01, 2016","objectId":"1755 1900 1912 2269 2582 2594 2620 2701 2788 2897 2978 3231 3366 3382 3390 3593 3749 4142 4492 4548 4557 4623 4629 4636 4944 5201 5490 5765 10564 10567 10582 10657 10661 10665 10740 10817 10901 10905 11277 11497 11665 11751 11814 13181 13647 19601 19682 19828 20170 20451 20593 20904 21473 21823 22150 22364 23060 23246 23266 23267 24044 24088 24167 24417 24487 25123 25505 25767 26506 30565 30881 31082 32458 33074 33075 34044 37283 65101 83081 83522 96679 100598 103211 104311 106210 107977 108266 108444 109066 109250 109562 112608 112651 112665 114173 114996 116116 116147 118927 119071 119354 120128 120432 120433 120437 120599 121267 123061","type":"exhibition","rotation":true}

Since her use of art historical concepts such as ready-made and recycling are so elastic she can develop forms that become endearingly awkward and self-effacing. âFeelingsâ is the head of a sad-eyed dog figurine, the top portion of which seamlessly transitions into her sculpted, oversized lower body.

The men that Her has photographed, in the tradition of classical paintings of generals, are veterans of that warâexcluded from subsidized health services, refused the right to be buried in national cemeteries, and disqualified from wearing U.S.âsanctioned military uniforms and medals.\r\nHere, they stand proudly. These Hmong Army veterans have awarded one another medals based on their oral testimony. Her sees these portraits as neither advocacy nor criticism.

In this exhibition, precious, rare volumes from the early 16th to the 18th century, on loan from the Wangensteen Bio-Medical Library, join artistsâ manuals, drawings, and prints from the MIA Prints & Drawing collection, and a skeleton and skulls from the Science Museum of Minnesota, to celebrate the glory of the human body.","date":"Saturday, May 02, 2015 - Sunday, December 06, 2015","objectId":"1404 1485 1801 7214 7277 7463 9199 9327 11947 11949 11955 14109 31862 33383 33397 33408 33438 43386 47058 48327 48328 48329 48330 52503 54564 55852 75876 107191 107205 111676 113647 114156 114253 114283 114395 115331 115360 116227 116413 116541 116545 116547 118937 119799 120598 120790 120857 122923 122924 122925 122926 122927 122928 122929 122930 122932 122933 122934 122935 122936 122937 122938 122939 122940 122942 122943 122944 122945 122946 122958 122959 122960 122961 122962","type":"exhibition","rotation":true}

This exhibition presents fourteen of the regionâs most important artists who use wit, critique, warmth, color, imagination, and beauty to celebrate, challenge, and expand our views of Native art.\r\nThese artists are boldly tackling universal issues of humankind, ideas about truth, life, justice, community and self. They also chronicle personal and social histories, biographies, activating and affirming aspects of their communities and selves. Each artist pushes through surfaces and some of our expectations of Native art, encouraging viewers to experience moments of revelation through the beauty of their work.","date":"Saturday, May 09, 2015 - Sunday, February 21, 2016","objectId":"6326 114548 120444 120610 121409 121412 121416 121417 121574 121575 122055 122905 122906 122907 122908 122909 122910 122911 122916 122931 122950 122952 122975 123059 124940","type":"exhibition","rotation":true}

{"id":1835,"title":"The Audacious Eye","description":"This first-look exhibition of over 100 highlights from the Clark Collections, recently acquired by the MIA, offers unusually rich and personal insights into the scope of Japanese art and the nature of connoisseurship. Bill and Libby Clark amassed one of the worldâs finest collections of Japanese art according to their own finely honed interests, instincts, and idiosyncrasies. Not trends. Not markets. Not a particular time, place, or medium. They collected what they likedâwhat drew their audacious eyes.\r\n\r\nThis exhibition hints at the stunning variety and bold taste that accorded the Clarksâ endeavor, begun in the late 1970s, a kind of legendary status. Tucked in the agricultural valley of central California, their collection grew from frequent trips to Japan, stoking their enthusiasm for Japanese aestheticsâtheir home is a blend of Japanese and California Arts and Crafts styles. The combined collection of the Clarks and the Clark Center for Japanese Art & Culture reached almost 1,700 objects, ranging across 10 centuries and from paintings to sculpture, ceramics to textiles, woodblock prints to works of bamboo. They include important examples from every school of painting in Japan since the 16th century and from some of its most acclaimed living artists, including 80 pieces by ceramist Fukami Sueharuâthe largest assembly of his sleek bluish-white porcelain in the world.","date":"Sunday, October 06, 2013 - Sunday, January 12, 2014","objectId":"116725 116738 116749 116774 116788 116865 116866 116877 116883 116888 116893 116914 116915 116973 116985 117025 117044 117053 117092 117093 117095 117106 117114 117116 117141 117152 117153 117157 117158 117159 117161 117162 117166 117168 117173 117174 117177 117178 117179 117187 117190 117191 117192 117193 117194 117196 117197 117206 117238 117239 117240 117262 117273 117284 117295 117306 117348 117360 117385 117388 117396 117418 117430 117436 117476 117498 117499 117510 117555 117584 117607 117762 117804 117805 117849 117850 117995 118095 118099 118129 118140 118151 118214 118215 118216 118218 118219 118222 118223 118224 118226 118232 118233 118234 118236 118239 118242 118244 118272 118273 118280 118346 118347 118356 118357 118388 118389 118402 118412 118425 118430 118432 118436 118455 118456 118457 118458 118463 118468 118474 118478 118482 118501","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

{"id":1838,"title":"Near and Far","description":"Though we connect with friends and family across the world by our voices, texts, and images, Shana Kaplowâs Near and Far explores the interconnectivity we share through our things. Kaplow focuses on the common chair to bring our attention to the products that fill our home, and asks whether a community can develop around the global reach of a shared commodity. Using ink on paper to conflate chair designs from both ancient China and modern Ikeaâwhich depends on Chinese mass-manufacturingâKaplowâs techniques of abstraction and photorealism stress the tension of connecting with the unfamiliar.\r\nKaplow also uses video to find connections between cultures, nations, and physical architectures. As part of her 2010 Red Gate International Artists Residency, she traveled to Beijing and recorded Chinese commuters as they passed her in the subway or below her balcony. When covered by projections of Kaplowâs video footage, the gallery walls become windows, and we can see the world as connected by more than our chairs.","date":"Thursday, April 16, 2015 - Sunday, June 07, 2015","objectId":"122976 122977 122978 122979 122980 122981 122982 122983 122984 122985 122986 122991 122993 122995 122996 122997 122998 122999 123000 123002 123003 123004 123006 123007 123008","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

{"id":1898,"title":"Southern Exposure: Photographs of the American South","description":"The Deep South is one of Americaâs most distinctive regions. Its unique character has developed from such factors as its early geographical isolation from the North, its difficult legacy of slavery, its gripping summertime heat and humidity, its enduring hospitality, and the international flavor of some of its cities. Indigenous and visiting photographers have captured enduring images of the landscape, architecture, and inhabitants of Dixie, from the time of the Civil War up to the present. E. J. Bellocq, for instance, sensitively portrayed women in the red-light district of New Orleans a century ago. Walker Evans made many of his iconic Depression-era images in the South. Danny Lyon documented the turbulent Civil Rights Movement there. And contemporary photographers like our own Alec Soth have been drawn to the mysterious ways of everyday Southern folk. The diverse work of these and many other photographers will present a rich collage of this southern sensibility. The exhibition will include about 75 photographs, drawn entirely from the MIAâs permanent collection.","date":"Friday, March 19, 2010 - Sunday, May 30, 2010","objectId":"2050 2194 2195 2196 2202 2212 2311 2640 2641 2645 2649 2709 2969 3041 3168 3591 3828 3832 4861 5023 8785 8789 8791 8825 9311 10575 10670 10674 10777 10780 10808 10958 11207 11225 11387 11675 11713 13181 13641 19358 19814 19816 20096 20099 20105 20131 21516 22484 22485 26415 26422 26424 26425 26427 26459 26465 26468 27804 27898 28067 28126 28253 28906 45319 45320 45327 45328 45336 45338 45340 45341 59717 64364 97476 101967 103739 103740","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

{"id":2043,"title":"Strangers in a Strange Land: Photographers' First Impressions","description":"Since the late 19th century, photographers have carried their cameras to unfamiliar neighborhoods and around the globe taking pictures of diverse people, places, and cultures. This exhibition features a range of classic masterpieces from the MIAâs collection that document photographersâ new encounters with foreign subjects and lands. The exhibition looks closely at how photographers translate a sense of culture, people, and place through imagery. It considers the power of photographic first impressions to shape historical representations of cultures that become lasting records of historical memory.","date":"Thursday, September 20, 2012 - Sunday, November 03, 2013","objectId":"139 1897 1901 2023 2025 2049 2050 3042 3203 3533 3751 3767 3786 3809 3825 3907 4383 10568 10569 10570 10571 10609 10627 10640 10671 10770 10771 10773 10948 19339 19340 19341 19344 19346 19368 19621 20063 20065 20101 20102 20132 20134 22114 23063 25384 30567 31177 32447 32450 32451 32453 32457 37269 52513 61399 62241 62243 62244 66330 79222 89324 99485 100064 100067 100068 100070 104235 106593 108444 109032 109033 109035 114513 114546","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

{"id":2155,"title":"Seven Masters","description":"At the end of the 19th century, demand dropped significantly for the once highly popular traditional Japanese woodblock prints, better known in the West as ukiyo-e. Publishers and artists slowed production and created fewer new designs. Yet what seemed like the end of a unique art form, without parallel in the world, was actually the beginning of another, as the path was cleared for a new kind of print: shin hanga. \r\nIn the 1910s, a few painters began to design prints that included much stronger references to Western aesthetics, painting styles, and techniques. Spurred on by the entrepreneurial publisher Watanabe ShÅzaburÅ (1885â1962), artists like Hashiguchi GoyÅ (1880â1921) began to create portraits of beautiful women, prints that early on were particularly cherished by foreign collectors. These shin hanga were produced in unconventional paper formats, different sizes than those typically used for ukiyo-e, signaling a clear break with the past. Also, instead of printing thousands of copies, as was common with ukiyo-e, publishers produced shin hanga in more limited quantities, ranging from editions of 350 to as little as 29.\r\nSeven Masters focuses on seven artists who played a significant role in the development of the new print and are noteworthy representatives of this new print movement. Drawing from the collection of Ellen and Fred Wells at the Minneapolis Institute of Art, the exhibition features the spectacular beauty portraits of Hashiguchi GoyÅ, ItÅ Shinsui (1898â1972), Yamakawa ShÅ«hÅ (1898â1944), and Torii Kotondo (1900â1976), the striking actors of Yamamura Toyonari (KÅka; 1886â1942) and Natori Shunsen (1886â1960), as well as the evocative landscapes of Kawase Hasui (1883â1957). \r\nPencil drawings and rare printing proofs offer insights into the production of woodblock prints, and, as these seven artists were painters as well as print designers, a selection of paintings offers a glimpse of their multiple talents.","date":"Saturday, September 26, 2015 - Sunday, March 13, 2016","objectId":"37797 45385 45386 62289 62292 62293 62294 62295 62296 62300 62304 62305 62306 62336 62341 62344 62345 62347 62353 62360 62368 62375 62376 62377 62378 62379 62381 62384 62386 62390 62393 62419 62424 62425 62426 62427 62433 62434 62435 62436 62439 62440 62441 62442 62443 62444 62446 62447 62449 62450 62454 62455 62458 62460 62461 62465 62467 62468 62471 62472 62473 62475 62476 62477 62478 62480 62481 62482 62483 62486 62487 62488 62489 62503 62504 62505 62506 62511 62514 62515 62517 62526 62527 62528 62531 62540 62545 62547 62549 62550 62551 62553 62554 62556 62572 62579 62580 62581 62582 62583 89653 89778 118928 118929 118983 119385 119386 119392 119402 119512 119645 123338","type":"exhibition","rotation":true}

These are watercolors, pastels, gouaches, charcoals, and ink drawings that are rarely exhibited out of concern for their light-sensitive materials. But now special new lighting in Gallery 353 is allowing the museum to show these works more routinely. This selection pays tribute to trees, variously interpreted as dancing, frightening, chatty, wily, and close to perfection. Some works entered the collection only in the last several years, including mouthwatering watercolors by Auguste LepÃ¨re, Charles Burchfield, and Childe Hassam, and this delicate bit of poetry by the impressive Dutch landscapist Egbert van Drielst.","date":"Saturday, August 01, 2015 - Sunday, March 27, 2016","objectId":"1643 1789 3359 4497 8762 9028 9457 9501 9552 10478 18257 103181 107186 111126 112886 114619 114891 115992 119344 121313","type":"exhibition","rotation":true}

{"id":2270,"title":"31 Years: Gifts from Martin Weinstein","description":"Martin Weinstein has given more than five hundred photographs to the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, in addition to numerous prints, paintings, and sculptures. 31 Years: Gifts from Martin Weinstein celebrate Martinâs thirty-one years of giving, from his first gift in 1982, Exchange by Jock Reynolds and Suzanne Hellmuth, to his most recent four in 2013, Paris (1989) by Elliott Erwitt; Falls 26 (2005) and Martin Weinstein, Minneapolis, Minnesota (2003) by Alec Soth; and Thomas (1987) by Robert Mapplethorpe.\r\nThe photographs highlighted in Martinâs collection are linked to many stories that are personal, institutional, and historic. One story is that of the collector, Martin Weinstein, a kid from Brooklyn, a sports fanatic, a teacher, a family man, and a prominent attorney, who discovers his passion for photography in the early 1970s and builds an outstanding collection. The other story is that of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, a museum that recognizes the power of photography as âthe leading and only popular visual meansâ in the 1970s. A third story is of a curator, the late Carroll T. Hartwell (known as Ted), the MIAâs founding curator of photography, and his long-standing friendship with Martin. And, finally, the most important story is that of a collection, the MIAâs photography and new media collection, which brings international photography to Minnesotans.","date":"Saturday, November 02, 2013 - Sunday, August 31, 2014","objectId":"3254 3255 3256 3257 3471 3937 3938 3939 4114 4136 4517 4619 4626 10665 10673 10682 10785 10883 10981 11325 11829 11838 11840 23144 23145 23146 24280 25054 26136 26154 26155 26156 26157 26163 26164 26169 26478 26480 26482 27259 27262 27310 27311 27313 27322 27326 27332 28044 28068 28232 28233 28241 28444 28446 60124 63356 63359 63360 63367 63368 83535 83536 83539 95803 95804 98679 101672 105207 106576 106832 116119 116120 116121 116122","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

From 1889 until his death in 1954, Matisse made thousands of drawings, prints, paintings, and sculptures of women. He was following a timeless tradition that also animated many of his contemporaries. This exhibition presents a varied selection of two dozen prints and drawings, primarily by French, German, and American artists, all focused on the feminine. Some of the artists intentionally introduced radical distortions into their work for expressive purposes. Matisse attempted to capture his sublimated desire for his models. Others sought to reveal the intimate or inner world of women.","date":"Saturday, December 14, 2013 - Sunday, June 01, 2014","objectId":"1591 1670 2761 3885 4460 7243 7380 8879 9187 13190 19534 21661 24099 25187 25571 33428 45258 46259 49671 50312 55135 56383 56387 91162 109684 114534 118619","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

{"id":2278,"title":"Make It New, Again: Collecting History","description":"In the 1930s, American poet Ezra Pound famously encouraged modern artists to âmake it new.â Modernists did so through abstraction, 12 tone music, collage, photomontage, and other experimental approaches to the visual arts, film, dance, and architecture. Today, to make it absolutely new is almost impossible given the sheer quantity of art produced since Poundâs slogan. Still, contemporary artists certainly make art that is new, again. And historic artworks acquire new meanings in our time. This photography exhibition will feature a selection of recent museum acquisitions by Richard Avedon, Stan Douglas, Marco Breuer, and Margaret Bourke-White, among others â many will be presented in the MIA galleries for the first time â in an innovative installation that reveals how powerful images acquire new and provocative meanings in different historical situations.","date":"Thursday, September 25, 2014 - Sunday, March 01, 2015","objectId":"1669 1922 2820 2821 2822 3297 3368 4538 4832 5018 5339 7835 10679 11537 11562 11914 19493 19887 20042 20479 22905 22907 24272 24952 25968 26015 26040 26238 27645 28224 28586 30075 58723 99110 99111 99168 100172 107223 108783 108784 108785 109112 109602 110200 111187 111188 111189 111190 111191 111192 111193 111194 111195 111196 111197 111198 111199 111200 111201 111202 111203 111204 111869 112651 112652 112653 113343 114514 114547 114969 115016 115021 115025 115352 115770 115771 115772 115819 115827 115828 116528 116530 118827 118837 119397 119599 119768 120054","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

{"id":2290,"title":"Delacroix's Influence: The Rise of Modern Art from CÃ©zanne to van Gogh","description":"EugÃ¨ne Delacroix was the very engine of revolution that helped transform the art of French painting in the nineteenth century. At his death in 1863, he was the most revered artist in Paris. The younger generation of painters from Edgar Degas to Vincent van Gogh scrambled to pay homage to his achievement and to explore his aesthetic theories, as articulated in his lifeâs work, much of which was accessible to the public, and in his incisive critical writings. If he was often described appropriately as the last painter of the Grand Style, he was equally one of the first modern masters and arguably the most influential artist of his epoch.\r\n This exhibition will investigate, through various thematic groupings of pictures, how and why this was so. The themes will range over some of the following: orientalism; color theory; religious and history painting at a crossroads; beasts, flowers and aestheticism; âmusicalâ painting; and the artistâs own unpublished âDictionary of Art.â \r\nIn addition to Delacroix, the exhibition will include works by CÃ©zanne, Van Gogh, Gauguin, Renoir, and others.\r\nA significant number of paintings from the Minneapolis Institute of Art will form the core of the show, including Delacroixâs Fanatics of Tangiers, generally considered one of the principal masterworks by the artist in North America, van Goghâs brilliant Olive Trees, and Signacâs initial pointillist work Snow, Boulevard de Clichy.","date":"Sunday, October 18, 2015 - Sunday, January 10, 2016","objectId":"111603 123658 123690 123692 123752 123758 123759 123771 123772 123773 123787 123792 123872","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

Among the objects are stunning ink paintings like Kichizan Mincho's (1352â1431) interpretation of the bodhisattva Monju by the artist, a 16th-century water jar (mizusashi) known as \"Burst Bag\" from the kilns in Iga for use in tea ceremony, a pair of folding screens of hollyhocks and plum trees by the artist Ogata Kenzan (1663â1743), a pair of screens of Chinese children playing \"crack the whip\" and examining an elephant by the eccentric artist Nagasawa Rosetsu (1754â1799), and a luminous 12th-century celadon Korean maebyong vessel inlaid with a pattern ofa crane amid clouds.

{"id":2307,"title":"Prints of Darkness: The Art of Aquatint","description":"For centuries printmakers have experimented with a wide variety of techniques to create tonal effects in prints. Aquatint, an etching technique developed in the late 18th century, introduces a porous ground to the printing plate through the application of resin that is fused to the plate before it is etched in the acid bath. The inked porous ground produces an effect akin to wash or watercolor, which artists have exploited to dramatic, evocative ends. The show features a range of works, from innovative early examples of the technique by Francisco Goya and Jean-Baptiste Le Prince to haunting, spectacular images from the 20th century by Otto Dix and Pablo Picasso.","date":"Saturday, October 31, 2015 - Sunday, May 15, 2016","objectId":"43021 43232 43476 55655 55656 55690 56550 57701 57862 57918 58290 58300 58311 66899 68669 68670 68684 80343 96527 96545 96565 96584 103214 115181 115679 116476 120361 123610 123615","type":"exhibition","rotation":true}

{"id":2324,"title":"America, Seen","description":"The first half of the 20th century was a time of enormous changes in American life. Industrial growth, unprecedented scientific and technological developments, and progressive social and financial reforms resulted in a higher standard of living, an expanded middle class, and greater levels of self-determination for both men and women. At the same time, global wars, economic depression, and racial and religious conflict produced suffering for many. These turbulent decades prompted insightful, often impassioned, responses from American artists whose perspectives conveyed many of the hopes, dreams, and fears of the public at large. This exhibition presents more than 45 original prints, drawings, and watercolors by such leading figures as John Sloan, George Bellows, Charles Burchfield, Thomas Hart Benton, John Steuart Curry, Grant Wood, Rockwell Kent, Reginald Marsh, Leo Katz, Elizabeth Catlett, Rico Lebrun, Ben Shahn, and many more.","date":"Saturday, December 19, 2015 - Sunday, September 04, 2016","objectId":"7251 7547 7667 7890 15919 20019 20020 28250 29251 30838 42876 43055 43056 43237 43238 43271 43352 43495 43846 43873 50421 51812 52040 52584 52588 54861 57422 58342 59576 59636 59968 64876 95968 106837 109688 115109 120494 121638 121676 121682 121776 121868 121936 121964","type":"exhibition","rotation":true}

Executed with amazing detail, the statues testify to a devotion to the two Archangels, which goes back to the Early Christian period, and continues to flourish in Southern Italy (as well as in the Greek and Russian Orthodox churches) to the present day. Throughout Christianity, Saint Michael and Saint Raphael are venerated for their healing powers. The exhibition celebrates the acquisition of these unique masterpieces, whose only comparables remain in Italian churches, but which have no parallels in any American museum collection.","date":"Saturday, November 14, 2015 - Sunday, January 03, 2016","objectId":"120728 120729","type":"exhibition","rotation":true}

With their horns and animal heads, they evoke the rituals of hunting societies. Other masks, with their pleasing features and colorful cloth, are meant to be fancy. These awe-inspiring, unconventional masks dance in the streets of Freetown, a major port city and the capital of Sierra Leone. They belong to the members of local youth associationsâthe urban successors to social groups that originated among freed and resettled African captives in the 1800sâwho wear them to entertain during weddings and public holidays.\r\nThe masks reveal this eclectic legacy, borrowing from various masking traditions and exhibiting a multitude of ethnic and religious influences. Whether fierce or fancy, these modern masks are like stylistic collages, celebrating the continuous reinvention of traditional art.","date":"Saturday, March 05, 2016 - Sunday, November 20, 2016","objectId":"124359 124360 124361 124362 124363 124364 124365 124366 124720","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

{"id":2373,"title":"James Castle: The Experience of Every Day","description":"James Charles Castle (1899-1977) was a self-taught American artist who lived his entire life in rural Idaho. Born profoundly deaf, he grew up in a small farming community surrounded by family members (including seven surviving siblings), but remained socially isolated due to his inability to communicate with others. Despite attending school for the hearing-impaired as a child, he never learned to speak or sign. Castle lived at home with his parents until their death, and then with other family members until his own death in 1977. He never married, nor had any children of his own. In addition to farming, his parents owned a small-town general store and operated the local post office. It was in this environment that Castle discovered his need and acumen for personal expression. The materials, subjects, and sentiments of his art were born of everyday life experience. \r\nHis collages, constructions and bound books consist largely of repurposed scrap materials, often stitched together with lengths of string or ribbon, and sometimes combined with hand-drawn designs and lettering. He made countless drawings on waste paper or commercial packaging, using a range of media that included ink made from stove soot and spit, and watercolor solutions he contrived by grinding and soaking color reproductions cut from magazines and other printed material. As a result, Castleâs drawings and constructions possess a material ingenuity and an engaging improvisational spirit that define his creative vision. His work is generally representational, though many of his constructions are highly abstract and only hint at their real-world inspiration. Castle occasionally produced non-representational drawings, whose subjects may in fact be merely unidentified. Above all, his work reveals a compelling and persistent inner need for personal expression.

{"id":2376,"title":"The Chronicles of Native Life: The MacMillan Gift of Seth Eastman Watercolors","description":"In a serendipitous merging of events, the Army put a talented artist-soldier named Seth Eastman at Fort Snelling in the 1830s and 1840s, when Native life was still intact around the Upper Mississippi. Captain Eastman spent his long assignment transfixed by Native ways, and he produced the most frank and intimateâif slightly romanticârecord of Native people in pre-territorial Minnesota. Mia is extraordinarily fortunate that the W. Duncan and Nivin MacMillan Foundation has given Mia 35 of Eastmanâs historic watercolors and drawings, most based on his Minnesota sketches. Among these small, detailed gems are Indian Sugar Camp and Gathering Wild Rice, believed to be the first-ever images of harvesting maple syrup and wild rice. Eastmanâs quiet observations are especially evident in Dakotah Encampment, which reveals wonderful details of tipi construction.","date":"Saturday, April 09, 2016 - Sunday, January 08, 2017","objectId":"6333 6334 6335 6336 6337 6338 6339 7687 36118 36127 36138 36162 36165 36167 36169 36170 36171 36179 64367 83459","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}

{"id":2399,"title":"Actual Size: The Triumph of Tiny Prints","description":"Many great printmakers sometimes went small, eager to see what virtuoso feats of miniaturization they could wrest from their engraving tools. Mia Life Trustee John E. Andrus III had a particular passion for these small-scale marvels, and now selected works from his exceptional collection are being unveiled in Gallery 344. They are part of a generous gift of more than 230 works from John and Marion Andrusâs three daughters, Elizabeth, Julie, and Catherine. \r\nThis display focuses on prints from the 16th and 17th centuries. Most are no bigger than a credit card. Some, like Rembrandtâs Goldsmith, have an intimate, personal feel. Other prints began life as ornamental designs for sheaths or brooches. A series of tiny religious scenes by Jacques Callot were meant to be used as paper substitutes for pilgrim badges. The German Kleinmeister, or Little Mastersâfollowers of Albrecht DÃ¼rerâexecuted diminutive gems with uncommon charm, playfulness, and technical refinement, as exemplified by this Italianate nude. Come enter this world of tiny treasures, and little by little they will take your breath away.","date":"Saturday, May 28, 2016 - Sunday, November 13, 2016","objectId":"120459 120474 121274 121275 121276 121284 121286 121287 121288 121289 121290 121293 121294 121295 121307 121316 121319 121321 121322 121326 121327 121328 121332 121333 121334 121345 121400 121401 121403 121404 121405 121406 121439 121453 121463 121464 121465 121466 121467 121469 121470 121471 121473 121474 121475 121477 121480 121495 121496 121499 121502 121510 121511 121512 121514 121527 121530 121531 121532 121533 121572 123035 124312 124313 124314 124315 124316 124317 124318 124319 124320 124321 124322","type":"exhibition","rotation":true}

{"id":2461,"title":"Die Neuen Wilden: Neo-Expressionism in Germany","description":"Selected from Miaâs permanent collection, this exhibition highlights more than thirty works on paper by seven leading artists of Die Neuen Wilden, an informal group of Neo-Expressionist painters and printmakers active in Germany from the late 1960s to the early 1990s. Epitomized by the radical experiments of artist Georg Baselitz, German Neo-Expressionism has been described as bold, raw, brutish, spontaneous, messy, vital, emotional, sensual, antimodern, antiprogressive, and at times even nihilistic.","date":"Saturday, September 24, 2016 - Sunday, June 11, 2017","objectId":"8551 9743 42964 42965 42966 42967 42968 42971 42973 42983 42984 42985 50304 80737 124958 124959 124961 124962 124964 124966 124968 124969 124971 124973 124975 124976 124979 124986 124987 124988 124994","type":"exhibition","rotation":false}
