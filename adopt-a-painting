Sadly, its inherent brilliance and details in the darker passages are obscured by its present condition. The removal of old discolored varnish (applied in 1952!), embedded grime layers, and discolored retouchings, followed by the application of new varnish, will restore balance to the work’s original color relationships and significantly improve overall visual impact. As the need for new in-painting is extensive, the treatment will be time consuming. With the exception of a small split in the upper right corner of the center panel that will need to be repaired, the panels are structurally stable in general. However, the irregularity of some of the edges has left slight gaps between the panels and frame housing. Minimal filling and toning of the uneven edges will reduce or eliminate these visual distractions. Treatment would also include the paintings on the reverse of the side panels that, when closed, depict the Annunciation.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\">Painting restoration: </span><strong>$25,540.00</strong>\r\n<h6>Frame</h6>\r\nTime has not been particularly kind to the frame that surrounds the Lucy Master’s triptych. Aside from the cosmetic concerns of dirt and grime, missing parts, cracks, and breaks in the wood (as well as joints that are loose and out of alignment) pose a deeper threat in their failure to prevent movement of the panels and consequent damage to their edges.   Restoration of the frame would include a thorough cleaning and consolidation of old surfaces, followed by filling, toning, and re-gilding in areas of loss.  Structural work would include reversal of old break repairs and restoration of the same with state-of-the-art methods.\r\n\r\nFrame restoration: <strong>$20,575.00</strong>","cost":"$46,115.00"}

Sometime in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, she became separated from her husband, who now hangs in the National Gallery of London. To add further insult to injury, she is dirty and flaking. But things are looking up for Mrs. Blocken – we have recently refound her given name, and she is long overdue for a thorough cleaning. Many of the darker areas in this painting are barely legible, and tests show that the varnish is doing her no favors – it is brittle, discolored, and over 60 years old. A web of craquelure along the panel’s wood grain is disfiguring, especially across Mrs. Blocken’s face. There are also scattered areas of lifting and flaking paint and various losses across the surface.

{"id":"15682","type":"adopt-a-painting","adopted":"1","description":"This was a big surprise! We removed the backing board of the painting in order to assess the full condition of the object, and found a complete, fully-realized composition on the reverse. Even better, the hidden painting was the more interesting and compelling image. After much discussion, we have elected to reorient the painting in order to display the “new” painting. This will require careful strip lining, a new custom stretcher, and a new frame. We will also have to relax the existing folds and creases that resulted from the artist flipping the canvas over and re-using it for another composition. Dirty varnish and grime will be removed from both sides of the canvas.  It is important to note that the changes we are proposing will not cover or in any way damage the smaller composition. Who knows what surprises lurk behind the canvases in our museums? One by one, we’re discovering them, with your help.","cost":"$4,755.00"}

{"id":"15668","type":"adopt-a-painting","adopted":"0","description":"Historically significant, this painting was gifted to the museum as part of the Works Project Administration. Given the subject and local interest, it would be wonderful to have the painting cleaned, repaired and placed on view. Structurally, the painting requires removal from its current stretcher, and the edges require careful strip lining before reattaching the canvas to a new, more supportive stretcher. Layers of dirt, grime and old, amber-colored varnish will be removed, and small losses will be filled, inpainted and textured to match the original paint. If you  like dramatic reveals, this is the project for you!","cost":"$3,120.00"}

{"id":"1627","type":"adopt-a-painting","adopted":"0","description":"Oh, how these poor girls need a little air! A discoloring, amber-colored layer of varnish obscures the darker passages of the painting. There are areas of retouching that have now blanched, making the restoration visible at a viewing distance. The varnish is covered with a moderate grime layer. Structurally, the canvas also needs assistance. There are draws and deformations at the corners, along with a series of sharp, small ripples visible along the entire left edge of the painting. Several tacks are missing at all four corners, and many of the existing tacks are loose and failing. There is a repaired 3-inch tear along the top right edge that is now cupping and tenting, due to the insufficient hold of the lining adhesive to the canvas fabric, and there is associated damage and loss of pigment around the tear site. During the restoration process, the canvas will be removed from the stretcher and humidified in order to relax the deformations. The painting will then be strip-lined, reattached, and properly tensioned on its stretcher. The varnish will be reduced and the disfiguring areas of obvious retouching will be removed and repaired.","cost":"$4,400.00"}

{"id":"1538","type":"adopt-a-painting","adopted":"1","description":"This painting needs a bit of TLC. It’s been installed in the galleries periodically, but it can really shine with some structural and cosmetic treatment. There is a small tear in the canvas that needs mending, canvas tension needs to be tightened, and several scattered losses and tiny puncture sites require treatment. Since the painting is unvarnished, as the artist intended, it will stay that way. The relatively thick layer of surface grime, accretions and dirt that the painting has picked up over the years will be carefully removed.","cost":"$1,630.00"}

{"id":"3743","type":"adopt-a-painting","adopted":"0","description":"<p>This large painting suffers from a thick layer of grime and dust – and the heavily impastoed paint surface and generous brushwork will make cleaning a time-consuming effort. In addition, there are a few areas of significant paint loss, where the paint has either flaked, or been picked, off of the canvas. These losses will be carefully filled and matched in a reversible process. No varnish will be applied to the surface, keeping with the artist’s original intent. To complete the project, we will also create “one less” distracting inner frame to support the heavy canvas. </p>","cost":"$3,805.00"}

{"id":"1886","type":"adopt-a-painting","adopted":"1","description":"<p>This nighttime scene is full of high drama that should not include visible repairs and poorly-executed inpainting, which has become more and more obvious over time. The numerous old fills will be replaced and corrected. The current, aged coat of varnish does not penetrate the paint layers, resulting in a dull, flat appearance; new varnish will give a greater sense of three-dimensionality and depth to the figures. Structurally, the painting needs assistance. The stretcher and frame require spacers (there are none at present to prevent shifting), and the securing hardware is inadequate to support the weight of the stretcher.</p>\n<p> Finished restoration on this painting will result in a beautiful, subtle change. It will also allow audiences to experience the dramatic candlelit commotion as Honthorst originally intended. This project requires a long, careful treatment, and the outcome will be worth the wait. </p>","cost":"$6,940.00"}

Palamedesz was best known for his military and “merry company” paintings, and with your help, this work will make an excellent pendant to our guardroom painting by Jacob Duck in the 17<sup>th</sup> century Dutch galleries. The original paint is in excellent condition, however, the entire surface of the picture is coated with a thick, glossy varnish that is embedded with grime and has discolored with age. Finer details are obscured, and the composition has lost its sense of depth. The dirty varnish significantly affects the color, giving everything a similar yellow-grey sheen. Removing the varnish would be offer a dramatic reveal.","cost":"$3,195.00"}
