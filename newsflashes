They emerged as a distinct culture in the 1800s when refugees from Mozambique’s coastal lowlands—teeming with slave traders then—fled to higher ground inland. In time they became Makonde. \n\nNow, the wreck of São José Paquete Africa, a Portuguese slave vessel, has been discovered off the southern African coast. It left Mozambique Island in 1794 for Brazil with around 400 prisoners from northern Mozambique.

The elephant. Who’s the most powerful leader in the Benin Kingdom of Africa? The oba, or king. What symbol of power most effectively conveyed authority? The oba’s carved tusk, like this one. Big time. \n\nFor the oba, the succession of power generally passed from father to son or brother to brother. Becoming and staying an oba wasn’t always a smooth ride, though. Who took the throne was sometimes disputed, spawning wars. And banishing your brother was not always the best solution, as Oba Uwaifiokun discovered in the 1400s. He exiled his brother Prince Ogun, only to be murdered by him in a nighttime ceremony in a market. Another leader, Oba Ezoti, only reigned for 14 days, after getting hit with a poisoned arrow at his coronation.    \n\n  — Susan Hopson, Learning Innovation Intern, October 19, 2016\n\nPhoto: Wikipedia\n\nTimed to coincide with the U.S. election, “Next in line?” is a series that highlights how power is transferred or demonstrated among a variety of cultures represented in Mia’s collection.\n\n\n","objectId":"1312","type":"newsflash"}

The 900s, especially, when two popes were murdered and a series of anti-popes—rulers who challenged the legitimacy of the reigning pope—took power.  \n\nAfter the death of Pope Clement IX, an arduous process of selection began, lasting four months. French and Spanish factions caused rifts among the cardinals. When no decision could be made concerning the three candidates, an unlikely candidate was proposed: Cardinal Altieri, an octogenarian. Because of his age, Altieri refused the post, offering up yet another selection. His protests were futile, and on May 11, 1670, he was crowned Clement X, assuming the name of his predeccessor. Clement X would go on to reign for six years, two months, and 24 days. Despite his foot-dragging acceptance of the role and his short tenure, he is remembered for his efforts to preserve peace throughout Europe.\n — Gretchen Halverson, Media and Technology Assistant, October 21, 2016\n\n**\n\nPhoto: Coat of arms of the Holy See, Donald Lindsay Galbreath, A Treatise on Ecclesiastical Heraldry, 1930\n\nTimed to coincide with the U.S. election, “Next in line?” is a series that highlights how power is transferred or demonstrated among a variety of cultures represented in Mia’s collection.\n\n\n","objectId":"1375","type":"newsflash"}

Roman politics had no shortage of intrigue. Germanicus, a nephew of Emperor Tiberius, was a likely prospect for emperor himself. As his star ascended thanks to his military prowess and good looks, Tiberius sent him farther and farther away. When he died of a mysterious illness, sources suggested foul play, pointing fingers at Tiberius. The death of Germanicus came to haunt Tiberius, whose popularity plummeted, ushering in a climate of fear and distrust that soon consumed Rome. Amid the anxiety, another suspect was identified: Tiberius’s chief advisor, Sejanus. Rumors of corruption resulted in*treason trials, in which *delatores,or informers, were used to root out rising stars from threatening the emperor’s grasp on power. Despite his best efforts to put distance between his nephew and himself, Tiberius goes down in history firmly tied to Germanicus, who forever remains the revered martyr. \n\n— Gretchen Halverson, Media and Technology Assistant, October 26, 2016\n\n**\n\nPhoto: Portrait of Germanicus, The British Museum\n\nTimed to coincide with the U.S. election, “Next in line?” is a series that highlights how power is transferred or demonstrated among a variety of cultures represented in Mia’s collection.\n\n\n","objectId":"1348","type":"newsflash"}
