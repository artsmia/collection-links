{"title":"Prayer Mat","description":"<p>This is no mere mat. It is a portable mosque. Like a mosque, this mat functions as a sacred space for prayer. A faithful Muslim prays five times a day: at dawn, noon, afternoon, sunset, and evening. Because going to a mosque to pray five times a day is not always possible, prayer mats were designed for the worshipper on the go.  The three spires in the center of the mat are a reference to Islamic architecture, and associate the mat with the mosque.</p>","link":"http://artsmia.github.io/griot/#/o/45269"}

{"title":"Basket","description":"<p>“Tying the knot” is shorthand around the world for getting hitched, taking the plunge—getting married. But in Somali weddings, at least, it was taken literally: women of the bride’s family made baskets like these and filled them with gifts and food. But one had a twist: it was tied with an impenetrable web of knots, and men from the groom’s family took turns trying to open it. Failure meant having to dance, sing, or otherwise entertain the bride. The groom was ultimately expected to win, but untying the knot didn’t symbolize the marriage coming apart. In fact, just the opposite.</p>","link":"http://artsmia.github.io/griot/#/o/111099"}

{"title":"Shrine Head","description":"<p>She’s beautiful, of course. You can imagine the glint in her eye, the gleam of her lips, so realistic is this ceramic sculpture from nearly 900 years ago. In fact, in 1911, a German explorer in Africa couldn’t wrap his head around the possibility that Africans created it—it’s so different from the abstract art more typical of the continent—and instead proposed that Greek settlers had made it. We know better now, thanks to archaeology and oral history: royals in the ancient city of Ife, in present-day Nigeria, often hired artists to create life-like portraits like this in clay or bronze of themselves, friends, and family.</p>","link":"http://artsmia.github.io/griot/#/o/4866"}

{"title":"Tusk","description":"<p>The elephant is the king of the jungle (no matter what the lion says). And its power, when push comes to poke, is in its tusks. It’s no surprise, then, that tusks have long made fitting canvases on which to celebrate the rule of kings and other powerful leaders in Africa, in this case the ancestors of a military commander, or <i>ezomo</i>, in Benin, who commissioned this tusk between 1775 and 1777.</p>","link":"http://artsmia.github.io/griot/#/o/1312"}

{"title":"44 Plates from a Christian illuminated album","description":"<p>If you spoke Ge’ez (and odds are you don’t – it’s an ancient language only used today in the liturgy of Ethiopian and Eritrean Orthodox Christians), you could read these 44 pages that were once sewn together as a book. At some point, they were taken apart and shuffled around, making their original order a mystery. We do know they’re more than 400 years old, illustrated with hand-painted Biblical scenes and Ethiopian saints, monks, and worshippers. And that they comprised a kind of devotional prayer book for an Ethiopian Orthodox Christian—so it’s lucky we have these pages at all, given how much they were handled. As for who’s who and what’s what, you’ll need to study your Ge’ez or dive into the subtitled version available here.</p>","link":"http://artsmia.github.io/griot/#/o/108767"}

{"title":"Toni Malau (St. Anthony)","description":"<p>To the Kongo people, St. Anthony was known as Toni Malau, or “Anthony of good fortune,” and he became popular at a time when the Kongo people needed all the luck they could get. In the 1700s, they were losing people to the trans-Atlantic slave trade even as a civil war tore them apart. A Kongolese noblewoman, Beatriz Kimpa Vita, began a movement declaring St. Anthony the savior of the kingdom. But Toni Malau did not save Beatriz Kimpa Vita. In 1706, she was captured by a Kongo ruler and burned as a heretic. The movement outlasted her death, however, and this ivory sculpture, carved over 200 years ago, is a testament to her teaching.</p>","link":"http://artsmia.github.io/griot/#/o/113136"}

{"title":"Cartonnage and Coffin of Lady Tashat","description":"<p>It’s a rich millennia-old mystery: Why was a teenage girl named Tashat buried with the skull of an unknown adult between her legs? And why are so many of her bones broken? X-rays and CT scans also reveal a poorly embalmed body and missing funereal jewelry, raising questions about those who prepared Tashat for the afterlife.</p>","link":"http://artsmia.github.io/griot/#/o/97"}

{"title":"Mami Wata","description":"<p>Mami Wata—exotic spirit, temptress of men, provider of wealth—might be wearing snakeskin if she wasn’t already draped in serpents. She’s a water spirit (her name means “Mother of Water” in Pidgin English), cruising the ocean like a mermaid/snake charmer. Although she first appeared in West Africa many centuries ago, this particular image of her became popular in southern Nigeria in the early 1900s. This unusually large figure was probably made in the early 1950s—dig the A-line skirt and trendy shoes. Street-wise and fashion-forward, she’ll share the secrets of her success with anyone looking to get a stylish leg up in the modern world and willing to pay her price: gifts and more, sometimes even celibacy.</p>","link":"http://artsmia.github.io/griot/#/o/111879"}

{"title":"Power Figure","description":"<p>A ritual specialist created this <em>nkisi</em> figure to consult the spirit world on behalf of those who came to the figure for help. The <em>nkisi</em> served as a modern-day mediator or attorney, maintaining order, enforcing agreements, and calling out wrongdoers. But instead of a briefcase and cell-phone, its tools of the trade were the nails, mirrors, beads, shells, teeth, metal hooks, string, cloth bundles, and other things stuck to it, which defined its powers and behavior. Dirt from a graveyard, sealed into a cavity in its stomach, gave it the spiritual charge to do its work.</p>","link":"http://artsmia.github.io/griot/#/o/1854"}

{"title":"Beer Pot","description":"<p>How is brewing beer like growing babies? The Zulu believe the same ancestral forces that ferment beer also create children in the womb. Zulu families will drink beer together and ask their ancestors to help grow the brood. Round, shiny black pots like this one are at the center of Zulu beer parties, refreshing the living while linking them to past family ancestors.</p>","link":"http://artsmia.github.io/griot/#/o/12111"}

{"title":"Initiation Mask","description":"<p>This one is all about the women. The day you received your drivers’ license, the night you crammed your toes into high heels and wobbled into the world four inches taller—these are typical milestones in the march to womanhood. But in parts of Liberia and Sierra Leone, a mask like this one is a major marker. Elder women wear them during the initiation of girls into womanhood, when they are instructed in ethics, marriage, childcare, personal finance, and traditional songs and dances. The mask reflects their shared aspirations: the carefully ordered hair, high forehead, downcast eyes, and dark skin are all Mende ideals of feminine beauty.</p>","link":"http://artsmia.github.io/griot/#/o/1937"}

{"title":"Yet Belt","description":"<p>Bling fit for a king. Heavy with bead and shell pendants, this <i>yet</i> belt was once part of the elaborate outfit worn by the king of the Kuba people in the Democratic Republic of Congo. None of the pendants match, a show of creativity and innovation prized by Kuba leaders. In fact, the notoriously fashion-conscious kings often help create patterns and symbols that become part of their personal “brand,” broadcasting authority and influence. Only the king and a few select members of his entourage can wear his signature designs.</p>","link":"http://artsmia.github.io/griot/#/o/3778"}

{"title":"Zoomorphic Altar (Boli)","description":"<p>It looks like a lumpy blob of dirt, more accident than art. But don’t let its humble looks fool you. The <i>boli</i> couldn’t have a larger, deeper purpose: it’s a portable altar and a symbol of the entire universe, imbued with spiritual energy. The <i>boli</i> came from the Bamana community in Mali and, as is often the case with indigenous African traditions, it was created by a team of artists, elders, and religious specialists to express in physical form some complex ideas and beliefs. Hidden deep inside is a small cloth doll. Over time, as bone, bark, nuts, soil, animal blood, and other natural materials are added to the <i>boli</i>, its spiritual energy increases.</p>","link":"http://artsmia.github.io/griot/#/o/115514"}

{"title":"Pair of Clappers","description":"<p>What is the sound of two tusks clapping? Carved from a hippopotamus tusk, this pair of human hands was designed as a musical instrument, an ancestor of the modern claves. Clapped together as a rhythm instrument, the tusks would have accompanied an Egyptian orchestra of harps, pipes, lyres, and lutes. The noise of the clappers helped drive away hostile spirits, keeping celebrations joyful.</p>","link":"http://artsmia.github.io/griot/#/o/115320"}

{"title":"Water Pitcher","description":"<p>Hand washing is automatic for most of us, something we do without thinking. But if you do it to honor your ancestors—and your ancestors happen to be the past kings of Benin—it’s a pretty big deal, especially since having a king for an ancestor probably means you’re one, too. Your royal hands will require a royal jug, perhaps shaped like a leopard—an animal admired for its ferocity, intelligence, agility, and speed. Qualities you probably see in yourself.</p>","link":"http://artsmia.github.io/griot/#/o/1358"}

{"title":"Fantasy Coffin","description":"<p>Imagine you’re dead (sorry), and a crowd has gathered for your funeral. They will bear your body through the streets in a unique coffin built to herald your wealth, status, and community standing. Now here’s an important question: exactly what coffin design would you want them to choose as a symbol of your profession or personality? Perhaps a larger-than-life lobster, complete with antennae and claws? Hey, it’s your funeral.</p>","link":"http://artsmia.github.io/griot/#/o/111088"}

{"title":"Hair Comb","description":"<p>To pull a comb like this through your hair was to sweep across cultures in a single gesture, a reflection of 19th-century Zanzibar, then the cosmopolitan capital of the Omani Emirate, host to a United States consul, and a bustling harbor to ships from around the world. The lucky Zanzibari woman who received it as a wedding gift undoubtedly identified as Swahili, a cultural melting pot stretching along the East African coast from Somalia to Mozambique, and parts of Madagascar, with roots in Africa, Arabia, Persia and India.</p>","link":"http://artsmia.github.io/griot/#/o/114833"}

{"title":"Egungun Costume","description":"<p>The true power and purpose of this Egungun costume is revealed only by motion. Swaying and twirling to the beat of a battalion of drums, an Egungun dancer communicates with ancestors, who play key roles in the Yoruba community long after they’ve passed on. Egungun ceremonies both honor the ancestors and call on them to protect their descendants from danger and misfortune, defend the good name of the community, and reinforce morals and laws. So deep is this communication that the performance is said to temporarily transform the dancer into his ancestors.</p><p>(10910293890123982190238, 2014-06-19 PM.
