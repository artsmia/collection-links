A faithful Muslim prays five times a day: at dawn, noon, afternoon, sunset, and evening. Because going to a mosque to pray five times a day is not always possible, prayer mats were designed for the worshipper on the go.  The three spires in the center of the mat are a reference to Islamic architecture, and associate the mat with the mosque.</p>\n","link":"http://artsmia.github.io/griot/#/o/45269"}

In fact, in 1911, a German explorer in Africa couldn’t wrap his head around the possibility that Africans created it—it’s so different from the abstract art more typical of the continent—and instead proposed that Greek settlers had made it. We know better now, thanks to archaeology and oral history: royals in the ancient city of Ife, in present-day Nigeria, often hired artists to create life-like portraits like this in clay or bronze of themselves, friends, and family.</p>\n","link":"http://artsmia.github.io/griot/#/o/4866"}

At some point, they were taken apart and shuffled around, making their original order a mystery. We do know they’re more than 400 years old, illustrated with hand-painted Biblical scenes and Ethiopian saints, monks, and worshippers. And that they comprised a kind of devotional prayer book for an Ethiopian Orthodox Christian—so it’s lucky we have these pages at all, given how much they were handled.

In the 1700s, they were losing people to the trans-Atlantic slave trade even as a civil war tore them apart. A Kongolese noblewoman, Beatriz Kimpa Vita, began a movement declaring St. Anthony the savior of the kingdom. But Toni Malau did not save Beatriz Kimpa Vita. In 1706, she was captured by a Kongo ruler and burned as a heretic. The movement outlasted her death, however, and this ivory sculpture, carved over 200 years ago, is a testament to her teaching.</p>\n","link":"http://artsmia.github.io/griot/#/o/113136"}

But in Somali weddings, at least, it was taken literally: women of the bride’s family made baskets like these and filled them with gifts and food. But one had a twist: it was tied with an impenetrable web of knots, and men from the groom’s family took turns trying to open it. Failure meant having to dance, sing, or otherwise entertain the bride. The groom was ultimately expected to win, but untying the knot didn’t symbolize the marriage coming apart. In fact, just the opposite.</p>\n","link":"http://artsmia.github.io/griot/#/o/111099"}

It has inspired many adaptations through the centuries and remains an important part of Japanese culture today. This pair of screens is ordered around the four seasons depicting scenes from ten different chapters based on what season they occurred in, versus when in the story they chronologically happened.  This pair of screens is one of the best examples of <em>The Tale of Genji</em> screens in the US for its use of gold, pigments, heavy detail, and its pristine condition. </p><p> </p>","link":"http://artsmia.github.io/griot/#/o/117153"}

But recent research revealed the identity of this elegantly dressed lady: Lucia Wijbrants (1638–1719), the wealthy widow of a Dutch cloth merchant. She stands at her dressing table, surrounded by her personal—and rather expensive—possessions, while the frisky spaniel at her feet begs for her attention.</p>","link":"http://artsmia.github.io/griot/#/o/4418"}

{"title":"Grainstack, Sun in the Mist","description":"<p>What happens to light when summer turns to autumn, the moon rises, or a soft snow falls? Monet found the answers, painting the same familiar scene near his home in Giverny in all seasons, at all hours, in all kinds of weather. A grainstack sits broadly in a field, the edges of its silhouette glowing as the sun climbs amid a cool mist to illuminate the landscape. Orange, yellow, green, and violet dance across the field as the earth meets the sky in a hazy blur. For Monet, this light was just as much the subject of his work as the grainstack itself.</p>","link":"http://artsmia.github.io/griot/#/o/10436"}

{"title":"Lucretia","description":"<p>How well do you know your Roman history? Even the most avid armchair Romanologist today might miss what was obvious to Rembrandt’s audience, even with few clues beyond a glinting dagger and a blood-soaked shift: the tragic story of Lucretia. The virtuous wife of a Roman noble killed herself after being raped by the son of Rome’s tyrannical king, and her enraged husband and father launched a rebellion to overthrow the king that resulted in the Roman Republic. This story, recounted by the Roman historian Livy, resurfaced as a morality tale during the Middle Ages and a model of republican values during the Renaissance: a leader must answer to the people he serves.</p>","link":"http://artsmia.github.io/griot/#/o/529"}

{"title":"Christ Driving the Money Changers form the Temple","description":"<p>Justice is served as Jesus boots the people preying on pilgrims out of God’s house. The painter known as El Greco loved this scene from the Bible.<em>  And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overturned the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of those who sold doves. And He said to them, “It is written, my house shall be called a house of prayer; but you are making it a robber’s den.” </em>(Matthew 21:12) His multiple takes on the subject mark his evolving artistic style, each subsequent version being more abstract and stylized.</p>","link":"http://artsmia.github.io/griot/#/o/278"}

{"title":"Blind Man's Buff","description":"<p>The cabaret is swinging—hard enough that time has lost meaning and modern sophisticates consort with mythological figures. Amid these pleasure-seekers stand two young people carrying candles. The girl is oblivious to the clamor, steadfastly waiting; the boy is blindfolded but determined to find her—they have a predestined connection. These two give the painting its title, after the old game in which a blindfolded child stumbles through the darkness to find and “tag” other children. When asked if the couple would ever find each other, the artist Max Beckmann said “Perhaps; let us hope it.”</p>","link":"http://artsmia.github.io/griot/#/o/1270"}

{"title":"The Death of Germanicus","description":"<p>The ailing Germanicus—born Nero Claudius Drusus—earned his honorary name as a tenacious Roman general, famed for his brutally successful campaigns in the early first century against the tribes of Germania. He inspired such loyalty among his troops and the citizens of Rome that his adoptive father, the Emperor Tiberius, dispatched him to a distant post in Syria. The general’s mysterious death at 34 fueled suspicions that Tiberius had him poisoned and sparked grief and anger across the Roman Empire. More than 1,500 years later, French painter Nicolas Poussin sought to stir those feelings anew, framed in the stoic restraint of the classical past.</p>","link":"http://artsmia.github.io/griot/#/o/1348"}

{"title":"Portrait of Mlle. Lange as Danae","description":"<p>Portraits aren’t always flattering—especially “poison-pen” paintings like this one. It was intended purely, and ingeniously, to damage Mademoiselle Lange’s reputation. For most Parisians, it confirmed what they already suspected: Miss Anne-Françoise-Élisabeth Lange was a talented actress known as much for her wealthy lovers as her beauty. Girodet painted her portrait, but she found his first effort unflattering and offered just half his asking price. Enraged, Girodet got revenge with this second, satirical version, complete with symbolic details that scathingly hint at her true character.</p>","link":"http://artsmia.github.io/griot/#/o/1727"}

{"title":"Study for Portrait VI","description":"<p>His vision is a dark one. Francis Bacon painted several portraits of popes (this is number six), and they all appear trapped, isolated and anguished—but beautifully painted. The portraits are based on Diego Velázquez’s celebrated portrait of Pope Innocent X, from 1650. And through his new way of depicting the human figure, Bacon showed what a portrait can be in the 20th century. In each of several studies he made for the painting, Bacon gave the pope a different face. Ultimately, he makes viewers feel as if they were behind the scenes, witnessing a private performance by a public figure.</p>","link":"http://artsmia.github.io/griot/#/o/1355"}

{"title":"Three Bathers","description":"<p>They were called \"wild beasts\" (<em>fauves</em>), for they didn't daintily dot a canvas with paint—they attacked it, aggressively brushing vivid color into mere suggestions of form. Henri Matisse was the leader of these artists, who transformed traditional painting by emphasizing the expressive power of color over the realistic depiction of their subject matter. It was the first revolutionary art movement of the 1900s: Fauvism. And although it seemed wild, even brutish, Matisse was aiming for balance, purity, serenity. <em>Three Bathers</em> is from Matisse's immediate post-Fauvist period, when he shifted toward radical simplification and used broad blocks of color to indicate land, water, and sky. Thick contour lines, both pictorial and sculptural, define the bathers and Matisse's struggle to reconcile multiple dimensions with two-dimensional design. </p>","link":"http://artsmia.github.io/griot/#/o/1411"}

{"title":"Warrior with Shield","description":"<p>Balancing between glory and destruction— to view this statue is to observe the opposing outcomes of war.  Artist Henry Moore is most known for sculpting reclining female figures with gentle lines and soft edges.  His style takes on new meaning when it is used to convey the violence of combat.  A reclining figure is a man struggling to stay upright.  Soft dimples are the gruesome marks of wounds.  Rounded edges are the shocking ends of missing limbs.  In the aftermath of World War II, Moore uses the balance between the softness of style and the brutality of subject to capture the shift between romantic ideas of heroism and the tragic realities of war.</p>","link":"http://artsmia.github.io/griot/#/o/1244"}

{"title":"Coaci Inkstand","description":"<p>You wouldn’t use this inkstand to write your grocery list. At more than two feet tall, made of silver, red marble, and lapis lazuli—a semi-precious blue stone—it’s one of the most imaginative examples of Italian decorative arts from the 1700s. Silversmith Vincenzo Coaci designed it in 1792 to commemorate a monument made several years earlier, when Pope Pius XV had a recently discovered ancient obelisk moved to the Quirinal Piazza, next to his summer residence. There, it was surrounded by two huge horsemen that had stood in that spot since their creation around 400. Topped with a cross, this rearrangement of ancient artifacts from the pagan past was an expression of papal power and a triumph of engineering.  </p>","link":"http://artsmia.github.io/griot/#/o/1748"}

{"title":"Piranesi Side Table","description":"<p>The ancient Romans were supposedly logical, orderly, restrained. When European tastemakers around 1750 translated their ideas of ancient Rome into a design style they called Neoclassical—literally “new classical”—they focused on symmetry, balance, and straight geometric lines. But Giovanni Battista Piranesi (1720–78), a well-known Italian printmaker, envisioned the Roman world more like a party. Riffing on Neoclassical motifs, he bent the lines into curvaceous flamboyance, like the over-the-top Rococo style that had charmed Europe a few decades earlier. An artist should be able to blend inspiration from various times and places, he argued, which is exactly what he did with this top pier table, usually set against a wall and often beneath a mirror.</p>","link":"http://artsmia.github.io/griot/#/o/8023"}

{"title":"Masterpiece cup and cover","description":"<p>When young Johann Friedrich Baer called this cup of his a “masterpiece,” he wasn’t being boastful. Every craftsman angling for membership in a professional guild had to produce a “master piece” to demonstrate his skill. The guild for metalsmiths required a covered cup, even though they had long been out of style. The panel reviewing Baer’s cup in 1746 declared his work to be excellent (despite a few microscopic holes in the casting) and he was accepted as a Master of the Echasse Guild, just like his father and brother before him and his son after him. Baer kept the cup until he died.</p>","link":"http://artsmia.github.io/griot/#/o/109118"}

And are those figures in the shadows real or hallucinations? Who knows? The old man has succumbed to that familiar feeling of weak and aching muscles, mind confused by feverish dreams, days lost to sleep. The painter of this picture—Francisco Goya, in a self-portrait—knew illness all too well. The younger man was his doctor, Eugenio Garcia Arrieta. Goya recovered to live another eight years and produce many more pictures, including this gift of thanks for his doctor.</p>","link":"http://artsmia.github.io/griot/#/o/1226"}

{"title":"Second-Hand Reading","description":"<p>Here’s a heavy question: How do you represent the trauma of history? The answer is usually uninspired: dreary, hard-to-watch images that don’t tell us anything new about suffering.  Kentridge was more original. His animated video is an unusual, diary-like take on race relations during apartheid, the South African system of racial segregation that was the law of the land from 1948 to 1994. It is serious and meditative, yet engaging and hopeful. As a cartoon character, he makes, erases, and remakes drawings within an old how-to book to emphasize that there are no formulas, only change. The book’s pages turn, like the movement of time, to mournful music by South African composer Neo Muyanga.</p>","link":"http://artsmia.github.io/griot/#/o/119599"}

But that’s exactly what one did in Vancouver, hiring Stan Douglas, one of Canada’s leading artists, to recreate and photograph a 1971 confrontation between police and pro-marijuana demonstrators. The so-called “smoke-in,” at the building’s location of Abbott and Cordova streets, revealed a clash of social values as the historically poor neighborhood began to gentrify with a middle-class influx, represented by the well-dressed onlookers in the photo’s margins.&nbsp;</p>","link":"http://artsmia.github.io/griot/#/o/115352"}

We may never know what this all means, but it certainly touches on many of Dürer’s interests: the artist as creator, mathematics, and the relationships between the physical, intellectual, and spiritual realms. Little was written about it when he made it in 1514, though it became one of the most discussed works in the history of art, a manifesto on knowing the unknowable and making the unmakeable. </p>","link":"http://artsmia.github.io/griot/#/o/113568"}

{"title":"The Church at Chailly","description":"<p>He was a master of the middle ground, solidly centering the action in the narrow strip between foreground and horizon. A gifted landscape artist, Jean-François Millet evokes the boundless space of the rural plains where he lived by squeezing into this space a flock of grazing sheep, a lone shepherd, a man driving a farm cart, and a row of thatched-roof houses among the lush green pastures. He began his professional career in Paris, exhibiting controversial large-scale paintings of peasants at the Salons. Later Millet moved his growing family to the small village of Barbizon joining an informal colony of artists drawn to the forest of Fontainebleau and its bucolic surroundings.</p>","link":"http://artsmia.github.io/griot/#/o/1637"}

{"title":"Ganymede and the Eagle","description":"<p>It’s a classic story of boy meets bird. The boy is Ganymede, a beautiful prince, and the bird is Zeus, father of the Greek gods. Zeus was captivated by Ganymede’s beauty, so he disguised himself as an eagle and abducted the boy to serve as the gods’ cup bearer on Mount Olympus. That’s the myth. But Bertel Thorvaldsen’s sculpture suggests a more benign interaction as the boy stoops to offer the eagle a drink and the eagle peacefully leans forward to accept. The eagle’s beak hovers just above the boy’s drink, and the two figures—the human and the divine—are frozen mere seconds before touching. An unnerving love story is reconsidered, revising the relationship between gods and humankind.  </p>","link":"http://artsmia.github.io/griot/#/o/1629"}

The time is 11:02 a.m. The title, Atomic Bomb Damage: Wristwatch Stopped at 11:02, August 9, 1945, Nagasaki, tells the rest of the story.

This unique woodwork, combined with fireplace tiles and light fixtures by Tiffany Studios and matching textiles, fill the homey historic interior with rich color and texture.
